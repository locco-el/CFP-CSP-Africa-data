This package conducts the analysis for a dissertation on the
relationship between Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) and Corporate
Social Performance (CSP) in Africa. It seeks to contribute to closing
gaps in the literature on CSP in Africa by pursuing three lines of
inquiry: firstly, how to measure CSP in the African context; secondly,
how CFP affects CSP in Africa; and thirdly, how the relationship between
CFP and CSP varies with firm characteristics. The gaps in the literature
that informed these lines of inquiry are discussed in further detail
below.
