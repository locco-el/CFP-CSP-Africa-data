Description: | This package conducts the analysis for a
    dissertation on the relationship between Corporate Financial
    Performance (CFP) and Corporate Social Performance (CSP) in Africa.
    It seeks to contribute to closing gaps in the literature on CSP in
    Africa by pursuing three lines of inquiry: firstly, how to measure CSP
    in the African context; secondly, how CFP affects CSP in Africa; and
    thirdly, how the relationship between CFP and CSP varies with firm
    characteristics.  The gaps in the literature that informed these lines
    of inquiry are discussed in further detail below.
