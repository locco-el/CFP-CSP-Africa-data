abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to: design a comprehensive, review-based and statistically tested corporate social responsibility disclosure (CSRD) index; measure item-wise and theme-wise the social performance of the top 82 companies in India; and investigate item-wise and theme-wise the variations in CSRD. Design/methodology/approach - The paper presents an empirical study of CSRD in 2009-2010, using content analysis, Cronbach's $\alpha$, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality and a six point scale (0-5), mean, skewness, kurtosis, and Levene's, Kruskal-Wallis's and Mood's median tests for analysis and interpretation. Findings - CSRD shows less satisfactory social performance, mainly narrative, and varies significantly among items and themes. Community development, with a mean score of 14.30, is the most disclosed theme, followed by HR, with a score of 11.20. The human element is the center of social performance in India. More than equal focus should be given to the environment and to emissions, which impact the greater interests of the world. Some burning global issues like water usage, alternative sources of energy, product safety and innovation have not received adequate attention. Research limitations/implications - The study offers ample scope for the further studies as each and every theme and item considered in the model/index requires individual focus to serve the future generations of mankind. Longitudinal/transnational studies in the area of CSR could be carried out to set the scene for further studies. Practical implications - The paper recommends mandatory CSR norms leading to improved disclosure, the sharing of innovative knowledge, cost reductions and enhanced effectiveness in managing scarce resources. Originality/value - The paper evaluates social performance in the economic, social, religious environment and highlights the emerging philanthropic attitude. The paper improves an existing model by incorporating an emerging dimension, i.e. Emissions of carbon and other harmful gases. The CSEEE index designed here is highly appropriate for developing economies like India.

abstract = {Purpose Sustainable manufacturing is practiced globally as a comprehensive strategy for improving the sustainability performance of the manufacturing industry. While sustainability is characterized into such three dimensions as economic, environmental, and social, currently, there is no quantitative method yet to measure the so-called "sustainability" in the manufacturing industry. The objective of this research is to develop a comprehensive and effective quantitative method to measure the overall sustainability performance of manufacturing companies. Methods In this paper, an integrated methodology is presented for the development of composite sustainability indicators based on principal component analysis (PCA). In developing this integrated approach, both industry and academia surveys are conducted to identify what sustainability indicators are favored by the sustainable manufacturing community. A unique index is then generated to measure the overall sustainability performance of industrial practices. The methodology can be used for benchmarking the overall sustainability performance of various manufacturing companies. Results A case study is conducted on a total of 11 global electronic manufacturing companies. The overall sustainability performance of these companies are measured, benchmarked, and ranked. The results showed that PCA is an effective approach for constructing composite sustainability indicators across environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Conclusions From this research, it is found that industry and academia have different views on the sustainability measurement, evidenced by different weights put on the same indicator in industry and academia. The case study demonstrated that the methodology presented in this paper is an effective tool for comprehensive measurement of sustainability performance of manufacturing companies. Strengths and weaknesses of each company can be identified. Then, the recommended improvements can be suggested based on the study of each of the individual indicators. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2012.},

@article{Aggarwal2019,
abstract = {Purpose: Wide differences in the focus and form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) exist among countries due to the different institutional embeddedness of CSR practices. The purpose of this paper is to seek to explain them within the framework provided by institutional theory by identifying important pressures driving CSR practices. Further, it intends to extend theory by proposing a conceptual model that relates institutional pressures, CSR practices, reputation and financial performance of corporates in a developing country like India. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon the extant literature on the constructs, the paper describes their evolution through decades and weaves relationship between them. Institutional theory provides the framework to develop hypotheses. Findings: The model has its roots in Scott's institutional theory – linking regulative, normative and cognitive pressures to CSR practices. Reputation mediates the relationship between CSR and financial performance. Practical implications: The conceptual model can serve as a foundation for subsequent empirical research. An understanding of relationship between constructs in the model will help corporates to strategize CSR initiatives. At the organisational level, insight into managerial perceptions of CSR practices will help to identify the need for training, if there is a gap between what organisation intends and what managers perceive. Originality/value: The authors have proposed for the first time an integrative model that will help to understand the antecedents as well as consequences of CSR practices in a developing country within a theoretical framework.},

@article{Amaeshi2016,
abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) amongst Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is often characterised in the literature as unstructured, informal and ad hoc discretionary philanthropic activities. Drawing insights from recent theoretical/analytical frameworks (i.e. Crane et al., in Corporate social responsibility: Readings and cases in a global context, 2013; and Valente and Crane, in Calif Manag Rev 52(3):52–78, 2010), and on empirical data collected from both Nigeria and Tanzania, we found that CSR practices in SMEs are much more nuanced than previously presented. In addition, SMEs undertake their CSR practices to varying degrees in multiple spaces—i.e. the workplace, marketplace, community and the ecological environment. These CSR practices go beyond philanthropy and in some instances involve institutional works aimed at addressing some of the institutional gaps in the environments where these SMEs operate. The paper makes a contribution by drawing attention to the multiple spaces of CSR practices amongst SMEs, and the institutional works they do, which are often taken for granted in the extant literature. We provide a unique perspective—by arguing that what is frequently conceptualised as philanthropic CSR in Africa is (or may include) ‘institutional works'.},

abstract = {Theoretically, measures of household wealth can be reflected by income, consumption or expenditure information. However, the collection of accurate income and consumption data requires extensive resources for household surveys. Given the increasingly routine application of principal components analysis (PCA) using asset data in creating socio-economic status (SES) indices, we review how PCA-based indices are constructed, how they can be used, and their validity and limitations. Specifically, issues related to choice of variables, data preparation and problems such as data clustering are addressed. Interpretation of results and methods of classifying households into SES groups are also discussed. PCA has been validated as a method to describe SES differentiation within a population. Issues related to the underlying data will affect PCA and this should be considered when generating and interpreting results. {\textcopyright} The Author 2006.

@article{Idemudia2011,
abstract = {The criticism that the mainstream corporate social responsibility (CSR) agenda was largely driven by the concerns and priorities of western countries and therefore tends to be insensitive to local priorities as well as inadvertently harm prospects for sustainable livelihood in developing countries set the tone for the emergence of a South-centred CSR agenda. The efforts to broaden the scope and content of mainstream CSR discourse and practice has meant three principal themes have come to dominate the emerging South-centred critical CSR agenda. The emergence of this critical perspective to CSR has not only contributed to the maturation of contemporary CSR agenda but has also generated rich insights with regard to the strengths and limitations of CSR practices within developing countries. However, the failure to critically engage with the role of government, adopt a bottom-up approach to CSR analysis and avoid a piecemeal research focus has meant the emerging Southern perspective to CSR is yet to achieve its full potential. This article suggests ways to address these shortcomings and contributes to the strengthening of the emerging critical CSR research agenda in Africa. {\textcopyright} 2011 SAGE Publications.},

@article{Inekwe2020,
abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of public governance and economic growth on corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in Egypt, Morocco, Mauritius, Nigeria and South Africa. It also assesses the trend of CSR performance in these countries over time. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a sample of five countries in Africa for the period 2012-2017. The multivariate regression model was used in testing the research questions/hypotheses. Robustness tests were performed to provide evidence to strengthen the findings of the study. Findings: Findings suggest that both good governance and economic growth are significantly positively associated with CSR performance. However, while good governance has a relatively substantial effect size, economic growth has a small effect size. Overall, both variables have a considerably low confidence interval ratio and therefore stand a good chance of holding up in future research. Research limitations/implications: The analysis is limited to within-country effects, thereby forgoing the opportunity to explain between-countries effects. Second, the sample size is relatively small because of the limitation of data availability on CSR in Africa; hence, population generalization is not intended but theory generalization. Practical implications: Findings have implications for studies on CSR performance in Africa that fail to consider the socio-political and socio-economic level of development as contextual variables in the research design. Originality/value: Prior studies on CSR have focused majorly on CSR performance–corporate financial performance relationship. Furthermore, there are several calls in the literature for research for a new direction on CSR in the context of developing countries, especially Africa. This paper responds to these literature gaps.},

Using data of U.K. listed firms for the period of 2009–2016, the study employs panel regression analysis and bootstrapping techniques to test study hypotheses. The results suggest that the presence of a sustainability committee improves the effectiveness of CSR strategies. The results also indicate that firms with effective CSR strategies exhibit better environmental and social performance. Further, the empirical results show that the effectiveness of CSR strategy explains the positive relationship between board sustainability committees and corporate environmental and social performance, thus supporting the theoretical framework of the study.

abstract = {Using two national culture dimensions, we show that the influence of firms' corporate social performance (CSP) on corporate financial performance (CFP) hinges on culture. Specifically, CFP is higher in those firms where CSR initiatives are congruent with the cultural environment. CSP has a negative impact on CFP for those firms domiciled in countries which are individualistic and favor flexibility. These findings are amplified for those firms with low levels of foreign influence in terms of institutional ownership and sales. Using a dataset covering 5334 firms from 41 different countries, our results indicate that culture and CSR initiatives have a powerful interaction effect in determining CFP, suggesting that CSP's impact is dependent upon the culture of the country where the firm resides.},

abstract = {Purpose: Firm size has been identified as one of the most important correlates with corporate social performance (CSP). Both conceptual and empirical research has been done to try to explicate and determine this relationship; however, the results from both theoretical and empirical research have indicated a mixed and sometimes inconsistent relationship because of endogeneity between firm size and CSP. This paper aims to add to the body of knowledge by identifying and addressing some of the limitations in determining the relationship between firm size and CSP. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Arellano–Bond method to control for the endogeneity, this study tests the relationship between CSP and firm size using a panel of 380 public companies of various sizes; in various industry types; and across 19 countries in North America, Europe and Asia over a six-year period. Findings: The results of the study show that firm size positively influences CSP and its subcomponents when endogeneity has been controlled for. Research limitations/implications: This study lends support for the theory of the firm framework that CSP attributes are embedded in the production process that leads to higher economies of scale, and the resource-based view of firms where firms that possess valuable and inimitable resources in CSR can lead to a sustainable competitive advantage over competitors. This suggests that as firms grow in size, they can leverage their resources to achieve greater economies of scale that will lead to better CSP over time. Originality/value: This study addresses the potential endogeneity problem between firm size and CSP and offers a broader testing context.},

We conceptualize each MNE as a unique portfolio of locations and use that “footprint” to examine the impact of formal and informal institutional distances on CSP. We hypothesize and find (1)a moderating influence of greater formal institutional distance in the MNE portfolio that slows the rate of increased benefits associated with greater international scope; and (2)a direct influence of greater informal institutional distance that lowers the overall levels of CSP independent of the international scope of the MNE. Managerial implications for international location selection are discussed.},

The main aim of this study is to analyze the moderating effect of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting quality on the relation of CSP and corporate reputation through two effects. First, it may enhance the firm's credibility because CSR reporting favors CSP consistency by reducing managers' CSR discretion and easing CSP comparability along the time. Second, it may increase the visibility of CSR actions beyond direct stakeholders involved in them. Analyzing an international sample of 132 companies from nine countries for the period 2011–2016, we show that all of the CSP dimensions (social, environmental, and economic) positively affect corporate reputation. We also find that good CSR reporting quality increases the intensity of the environmental and social performance effects on corporate reputation. Results provide a new perspective of the role CSR reporting quality that managers have to deal to get better impacts of CSP on corporate reputation.},

abstract = {Manuscript Type: Review Research Question/Issue: This study provides a systematic multi-level review of recent literature to evaluate the impact of corporate governance mechanisms (CG) at the institutional, firm, group, and individual levels on firm level corporate social responsibility (CSR) outcomes. We offer critical reflections on the current state of this literature and provide concrete suggestions to guide future research. Research Findings/Insights: Focusing on peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to 2015, the review compiles the evidence on offer pertaining to the most relevant CG mechanisms and their influence on CSR outcomes. At the institutional level, we focus on formal and informal institutional mechanisms, and at the firm level, we analyze the different types of firm owners. At the group level, we segregate our analysis into board structures, director social capital and resource networks, and directors' demographic diversity. At the individual level, our review covers CEOs' demography and socio-psychological characteristics. We map the effect of these mechanisms on firms' CSR outcomes. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We recommend that greater scholarly attention needs to be accorded to disaggregating variables and yet comprehending how multiple configurations of CG mechanisms interact and combine to impact firms' CSR behavior. We suggest that CG-CSR research should employ a multi-theoretical lens and apply sophisticated qualitative and quantitative methods to enable a deeper and finer-grained analysis of the CG systems and their influence on CSR. Finally, we call for cross-cultural research to capture the context sensitivities typical of both CG and CSR constructs. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review suggests that for structural changes and reforms within firms to be successful, they need to be complemented by changes to the institutional makeup of the context in which firms function to encourage/induce substantive changes in corporate responsible behaviors.},

Recently, management control practices have emerged to provide a broader type of information for evaluating the effectiveness of healthcare policies, and relate activities and processes to multiple strategic outcomes. This study compares the effect of traditional and contemporary management control practices on the achievement of public health policies. It is also analyzed how two different uses of such practices (enabling vs. coercive) facilitate the achievement of public health policies. Relationships are explored using data collected from managers from public health agencies and public hospitals in Spain. The findings show that contemporary management control practices are more suitable than traditional practices to achieve public health policies. Furthermore, results show that public health policies are better achieved when managers use management control practices in an enabling way rather than in a coercive way.},

A mediating effect of environmental performance on the link between eco-control and economic performance is observed in different contexts.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore causal complexity in the relationship between environmental proactivity and firm performance. Using data collected from 27 Australian firms and controlling for the organizational life cycle, type of industry and external contingencies, the study empirically examines environmental proactivity in high-performing firms from polluting industries. Design/methodology/approach - The data were analyzed using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings - In general, the results of the analysis imply that environmental proactivity is not always associated with high firm performance, and that environmental proactivity is not as important as the other causal conditions for high-performing firms in highly polluting industries. Research limitations/implications - The study addresses the relationship between environmental and firm performance more holistically by including a number of the firm's external and internal factors identified as important in past research. Second, it offers a new perspective on the relationship with its systematic comparative analysis of complex cases. Next, it identifies different combinations of conditions (paths) leading to a high firm performance and, finally, the core complementary model allows an exploration of which factors are essential and which are less important or even irrelevant to high-performing firms. Practical implications - Based on the findings, firms from highly polluting industries can determine in which circumstances, if any, the adoption of environmental proactivity will result in a positive firm performance. Originality/value - The study is valuable because it contains a rich set of measures of the firm's external and internal environment, thus allowing a more holistic examination of the relationship between environmental proactivity and firm performance.},

Analyzing the global environmental standards of a sample of U.S.-based MNEs in relation to their stock market performance, we find that firms adopting a single stringent global environmental standard have much higher market values, as measured by Tobin's q, than firms defaulting to less stringent, or poorly enforced host country standards. Thus, developing countries that use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, firms. Our results also suggest that externalities are incorporated to a significant extent in firm valuation. We discuss plausible reasons for this observation.},

abstract = {Purpose: Corporate social responsibility is important and fundamental to the sustainable operations of corporations. Similarly financial performance is undoubtedly fundamental to the continuing operating of any corporation. This paper aims to investigate the relationship between corporate social responsibility and firm financial performance. Design/methodology/approach: The main part of this paper is based upon an exploration of the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance in developing countries. The authors do this by investigating the Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) 100 index companies and their social responsibility policy and financial indicators. The relationship between CSR and financial performance is empirically examined between 2005 and 2007 with different approaches and measurement methods. The authors show that some causality is related to lagging between periods for financial performance and CSR. Based upon previous empirical studies, this study conducts the analysis based on the assumption that there may be a relationship between firm size, profitability, risk level and CSR. Findings: In doing this analysis the authors found a relationship between firm size and corporate social responsibility. However the authors were not able to find any significant relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance/profitability. Research limitations/implications: The paper has implications in enhancing the understanding of performance management through understanding the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance particularly in a developing country, although it is necessarily limited by the size of the sample. Originality/value: This paper increases the understanding of the relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance.

abstract = {Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) indices play a major role in the stock markets. A connection between doing good and doing well in business is implied. Leading indices, such as the Domini Social Index and others, exemplify the movement toward investing in socially responsible corporations. However, the question remains: Does the ratings-based methodology for assessing corporate social responsibility (CSR) provide an incentive to firms excluded from SRI indices to invest in CSR? Not in its current format. The ratings-based methodology employed by SRI indices in their selection processes excludes many corporations by creating limited-membership lists. This received ratings-based structure is yet to offer an incentive for most of the excluded corporations to invest in improving their levels of CSR. We, therefore, ask under what circumstances a ratings-based method for assessing CSR could provide an incentive to firms excluded from SRI indices to invest in CSR. In this article, we attempt to offer a theoretical reply to this question. We show that when all firms are publicly ranked according to SRI index parameters, such indices can indeed create a market incentive for increased investment by firms in improving their performance in the area of social responsibility. We further show that this incentive tapers off as the amount of investment required exceeds a certain point or if the amount of payback on that investment fails to reach a certain threshold. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This study explores corporate strategies to mitigate climate change of large CO2 polluters. Unlike most prior studies in the area, which have attempted to identify configurations of firms pursuing similar strategies, this study appraises the relationships between nineteen carbon reduction practices and their underlying strategies. The findings are based on a sample of 158 carbon-intensive firms from three EU countries. Five main strategies in carbon-intensive firms are identified. The only relatively widely deployed strategy is emissions trading. The remaining strategies, including process emissions reduction, combustion emissions reduction, external measures, and lowering product output are not deployed extensively. Complementarity between the identified strategies is low - firms focus on a single climate change mitigation strategy rather than deploying several simultaneously.Climate policy stringency appears to have a positive effect on corporate efforts to reduce emissions.},

This research responds to Dyllick and Muff's assertion that this paradox is caused by a constricted understanding of the meaning of corporate sustainability, lack of inclusion of constructs from related streams of literature, and failure to integrate micro and macro perspectives of sustainability. The current research addresses these concerns through an integration of 22 micro- and macro-level models of stages of development from literature in corporate sustainability, corporate social responsibility, environmental management, and sustainable development. This integration results in a new unified model of stages of corporate sustainability that broadens the current narrowly constricted understanding of corporate sustainability, extends the paradigm of corporate sustainability beyond the business case and into the realm of ecological science and strong sustainability, and sheds light on the paradox.},

First of all, they detail a wide spectrum of agreement by those who are stakeholder theorists. Second, they rightly emphasize so-called instrumental stakeholder theory as the most promising candidate for theoretical development. Finally, they link stakeholder theory to broader areas of management scholarship. Using convergent stakeholder theory as a grand concept for integrating the many strands of stakeholder thinking is a natural idea given the current state-of-the-art of management theory and its penchant for consensus and agreement, and given the usually divergent poles of positivism and relativism (Wicks & Freeman, 1998).},

This study employs the institution-based view of international business strategy to explore how managerial perceptions of specific dimensions of legal system uncertainty - ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and ex-post judicial arbitrariness - will act as determinants of WOFS political tie intensity. Our analysis of 181 WOFSs in the Philippines suggests that managerial perceptions of ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and ex-post judicial arbitrariness, being two distinct dimensions of legal system uncertainty, are determinants of political tie intensity. We also find that the positive association between managerial perceptions of ex-ante commercial law inadequacy and the intensification of political ties grows stronger when a WOFS is committed to organizational adaptation of capabilities to the local context, while the positive association between managerial perceptions of ex-post judicial arbitrariness and the intensification of political ties grows stronger when a WOFS is engaged in strategically positioning operations in an emerging market environment.},

abstract = {Foreign firms in emerging countries face various institutionally-driven challenges. Nonmarket strategy scholars argue that these challenges incite corporate political activity. Consequently, researchers have explored the influence of institutional factors on the choice and extent of political strategies. However, not much is known about how investment climate constraints affect the political ties of foreign firms in contexts other than US, Europe and Asia. Drawing on institutional theory, we propose that firms' exposure to administrative and control constraints as well as the presence of public affairs (PA) functions will lead to political tie intensification. We test our propositions using data from foreign firms operating in Ghana, and find that whereas control constraints strengthen political ties, administrative constraints weaken these ties. The findings also suggest that PA functions and political ties can be substitutes, not complements, depending on the institutional contingencies. Altogether, our study enhances knowledge and understanding of how institutional environments and organizational structures affect the political behaviour of foreign firms in emerging countries.},

abstract = {This study aims to trace the conceptual evolutionary path of theories on corporate social responsibility (CSR) and to reflect on the implications of the development. The retrospection has revealed that the trend has been a progressive rationalization of the concept with a particular focus on tighter coupling with organizations' financial goals. Rationalization involves two broad shifts in the conceptualization of CSR. First, in terms of the level of analysis, researchers have moved from the discussion of the macro-social effects of CSR to organizational-level analysis of CSR's effect on profit. Next, in terms of theoretical orientation, researchers have moved from explicitly normative and ethics-oriented arguments to implicitly normative and performance-oriented managerial studies. Based on the retrospection, the limitations of the current state of CSR research that places excessive emphasis on the business case for CSR are outlined, and it is suggested that future research needs to refocus on basic research in order to develop conceptual tools and theoretical mechanisms that explain changing organizational behavior from a broader societal perspective. {\textcopyright} Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2007.},

The efforts to broaden the scope and content of mainstream CSR discourse and practice has meant three principal themes have come to dominate the emerging South-centred critical CSR agenda. The emergence of this critical perspective to CSR has not only contributed to the maturation of contemporary CSR agenda but has also generated rich insights with regard to the strengths and limitations of CSR practices within developing countries. However, the failure to critically engage with the role of government, adopt a bottom-up approach to CSR analysis and avoid a piecemeal research focus has meant the emerging Southern perspective to CSR is yet to achieve its full potential.

Some people restrict sustainability to environmental issues, and others use it synonymously with corporate social responsibility. In this essay, we return to the roots of its original meaning and argue that sustainability requires the consideration of time. Sustainability obliges firms to make intertemporal trade-offs to safeguard intergenerational equity. In this essay, we clarify the meaning of sustainability by showing that the notion of 'time' discriminates sustainability from responsibility and other similar concepts. We then argue that the omission of time from most strategic management has contributed to short-termism, which is the bane sustainability. We conclude with directions for future research that will integrate sustainability into strategy and contribute to a world in which both business and society can thrive for generations to come. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2014.},

The business case refers to the underlying arguments or rationales supporting or documenting why the business community should accept and advance the CSR 'cause'. The business case is concerned with the primary question: What do the business community and organizations get out of CSR? That is, how do they benefit tangibly from engaging in CSR policies, activities and practices? The business case refers to the bottom-line financial and other reasons for businesses pursuing CSR strategies and policies. In developing this business case, the paper first provides some historical background and perspective. In addition, it provides a brief discussion of the evolving understandings of CSR and some of the long-established, traditional arguments that have been made both for and against the idea of business assuming any responsibility to society beyond profit-seeking and maximizing its own financial well-being. Finally, the paper addresses the business case in more detail. The goal is to describe and summarize what the business case means and to review some of the concepts, research and practice that have come to characterize this developing idea. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and British Academy of Management.},

abstract = {There is a lack of research about the political strategies used by firms in emerging countries, mainly because the literature often assumes that Western-oriented corporate political activity (CPA) has universal application. Drawing on resource-dependency logics, we explore why and how firms orchestrate CPA in the institutionally challenging context of Nigeria. Our findings show that firms deploy four context-fitting but ethically suspect political strategies: affective, financial, pseudo-attribution and kinship strategies. We leverage this understanding to contribute to CPA in emerging countries by arguing that corporate political strategies are shaped by the reciprocity and duality of dependency relationships between firms and politicians, and also by advancing that these strategies reflect institutional weaknesses and unique industry-level opportunities. Importantly, we shed light on the muttered dark side of CPA. We develop a CPA framework and discuss the research, practical and policy implications of our findings.},

Yet the body of evidence that has accumulated about the nature of the relationship is equivocal. A commonly identified reason for the diverse and contradictory results is measurement issues pertaining to both concepts of interest. This article aims to review alternative operationalisations and measurement approaches for the CSR and CFP concepts that have been deployed in empirical literature concerned with the CSR–CFP relationship. Several findings emanate from our study. First, CSR operationalisations in empirical literature range from multidimensional to one-dimensional. Second, CSR measurement approaches include reputation indices, content analyses, questionnaire-based surveys and one-dimensional measures, whereas CFP measurement approaches include accounting-based measures, market-based measures and combined measures. Third, no CSR measurement approach is without drawbacks. In addition to approach specific drawbacks, two problems inherent in most approaches are researcher subjectivity and selection bias that may influence the nature of CSR–CFP relationship detected in empirical literature. Finally, potential pathways to remedy these drawbacks are suggested.},

@article{Sarkar2016,
abstract = {Despite its increasing relevance, corporate social responsibility (CSR) remains hobbled by problems, variously charged as being chameleon, vacuous or an utterly meaningless concept. One reason is the absence of an agreed upon normative basis underpinning CSR. This is in large part due to the concept lacking a universally accepted definition. This paper explores how the concept of CSR has evolved over time drawing from 110 definitions of the construct. Using co-word analysis of definitions from 1953 to 2014, the study maps how the structure of the definitions has evolved during the field's historical development. The research uncovers the key terms underpinning the phenomenon, the centrality of these terms as well as mapping their interrelationships and evolution. The findings suggest that, despite the profusion and definitional heterogeneity over the six decades of the development of the field, there are six recurrent, enduring dimensions that underpin the CSR concept. These dimensions are economic, social, ethical, stakeholders, sustainability and voluntary. This paper makes several contributions to the academic literature. The systematic, quantitative analysis of definitions brings an objectivity that previous qualitative bibliometric analyses of CSR have lacked. The time period selected is substantially longer than previous analyses and captures the complete historical evolution of the concept. Moreover, the analysis provides the basis for the development of a new, comprehensive, yet concise, definition of CSR that captures all six of the recurring dimensions underpinning the concept.},

This paper aims to empirically test the curvilinear relationship between CSR and FP in the context of Indian companies.Design/methodology/approachThis paper empirically tests the curvilinear relationship between CSR and FP in the context of Indian companies. The study used a panel data of 43 listed companies over a period of ten years from 2008 to 2017. A correlation and panel regression were carried out to examine the possible link.FindingsThe findings demonstrate that a curvilinear relationship exists between CSR and FP, suggesting that two long competing viewpoints may be complementary.Research limitations/implicationsThe study mainly focuses on top companies, so the generalizations of results to other small companies are unwanted.Practical implicationsAn immediate managerial implication of the findings suggests that to serve the interests of the shareholders, a long-run planning and considerable resources should be dedicated at this direction, given that CSR expenditure does not pay off immediately.Originality/valueIn the Indian context, very few studies have analyzed the linkages between CSR and FP. Using an improved and distinctive approach, the study empirically tests the relationship between CSR and FP from non-linear perspective.},

This study is intended to advance this debate by arguing for the existence of curvilinear relationship and empirically testing the same using survey data on UK manufacturing firms. FP is captured in terms of growth in sales and market share. Our results show evidence for a quadratic relationship—as firms improve their EP, they seem to achieve much higher levels of FP. These results are consistent with the resource-based view of a firm; as firms engage in EP activities, they are able to gain inimitable knowledge that helps in further learning to further improve performance. Based on our results, we suggest that new studies focus on strategies to extend the period of increasing returns and maximizing the benefits of the positive association between EP and FP.},

In close parallel to these changes are differences in interpretation from Anglo- American and Continental European perspectives.The author defends that the ultimate reasons behind these differences are of a philosophical nature, affecting both the anthropology and the political theory dominant in each of these cultures. Philosophically, anglo-american culture may be described as individualistic, legalistic, pragmatist and with an understanding of rights as freedom from state intervention. Continental European culture, on the other hand, is more community-oriented, more dependent on unwritten laws or customs, less resultsdriven or more appreciative of the intrinsic value of activities and with an understanding of rights as freedom to participate in social goods and decisions. In the end, a twist is introduced in the meaning of corporate citizenship: beyond referring to the firm as a citizen of the state, it now signifies and analyzes the rights and responsibilities of the different "citizens" comprising the corporate polity.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to determine how national cultural context may be harnessed to support corporate social responsibility (CSR) implementation when sourcing fashion garments from developing country manufacturers. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study approach was adopted, using purposive sampling to select seven export garment manufacturers of varying size and business model in Sri Lanka. Primary data were collected through on-site, face-to-face interviews with managerial level and operational level informants within each company and through non-participant observation within factory environments. Findings: It was found that harnessing the local cultural context can support and progress CSR implementation at the factory level: in Sri Lanka, the Buddhist philosophy provided the moral underpinning and hence facilitated supplier engagement with CSR implementation. The presence of governmental support reduces the likelihood of CSR transgressions by adding an extra level of accountability for suppliers. Furthermore, the level of socioeconomic development also affects CSR implementation, as managerial competency increases with higher education levels. Practical implications: Analysing the success of CSR implementation in the Sri Lankan export garment manufacturing industry enables the identification of country-specific factors which support CSR implementation. The managerial perspective taken within the research would be of use to fashion brands and retailers that are looking for ways of progressing CSR implementation in their global supply chains. Originality/value: This paper presents industry-specific data from a key global garment manufacturing country on a commercially sensitive subject. It identifies factors within the national cultural context that support CSR implementation in the fashion supply chain. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

@article{Cochran1984,
abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the interaction between sustainability and financial performance. Can socially responsible investors, integrating environmental, social and ethical issues in their investment policy, expect the same return as traditional investors? Design/methodology/approach - Based on the sustainability ratings of a specialized rating agency, Vigeo, a Fama and French approach is performed to adapt for style biases in the performances. Findings - The results indicate that, on a style-adjusted basis, high sustainability-rated portfolios have performed better than low-rated portfolios, but, probably due to the short horizon, not to a significant extent. The same results are found for four out of the five sub-ratings of which the sustainability rating is composed, suggesting that sustainability is a broad and multidimensional concept that cannot be attributed to one specific theme or topic. The results also indicate that investors are ready to pay a premium for companies with good management of their relations with shareholders, clients and suppliers. Research limitations/implications - Owing to the rather new concept of socially responsible investing and in order to avoid survivorship bias, only a relative time horizon is considered. Practical implications - There is no cost involved in integrating sustainable dimensions in the investment policy.

abstract = {We outline a supply and demand model of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Based on this framework, we hypothesize that a firm's level of CSR will depend on its size, level of diversification, research and development, advertising, government sales, consumer income, labor market conditions, and stage in the industry life cycle. From these hypotheses, we conclude that there is an "ideal" level of CSR which managers can determine via cost-benefit analysis, and that there is a neutral relationship between CSR and financial performance.},

abstract = {This paper first sets a definition of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as an extended model of corporate governance and then accounts for a voluntary approach to CSR, meant as voluntary compliance with CSR strategic management standards, in terms of an economic theory of self-regulation based on the concepts of social contract, reputation and reciprocal conformism. The paper argues that extended fiduciary duties toward all the firm's stakeholders are needed because of the same neo-institutional analysis of the firm that justifies it as a unified system of governance of economic transactions based on authority relations and residual rights of control. The key concept here is that of abuse of firm's authority vis-a-vis the stakeholders who hold incomplete contracts with the firm. Extended fiduciary duties are singled out from the model of a Social Contract amongst the firm's stakeholders. This provide for a clear cut and calculable criterion of strategic management no less able to set a bottom-line to the firm management than the profit maximisation principle, while being able of answering legitimate claims of fair treatment from all the firm's stakeholders. Such a task is accomplished by an application of the theory of bargaining games to the Social Contract of the firm, which employs the Nash-Harsanyi bargaining solution as a normative criterion for strategic management and corporate governance, providing an answer to the deficit of uniqueness problem raised by Michael Jensen (2001) against the notion of stakeholders value. Then, the paper distinguishes two models of self regulation (the discretionary one, and the explicit-norms-cum-self-enforcement one) and argues that while incomplete contracts and imperfect knowledge debar form resorting to reputation effects in order to support discretional self-regulation, on the contrary an explicit standard for CSR strategic management, based on general and abstract business ethics principles and precautionary protocols and rules of behaviour - both publicly shared by stakeholders and firms through social dialog - make possible to put again at work the reputation mechanism inducing endogenous incentives of compliance with a voluntary standard. The paper here suggests how (by both fuzzy logic and default reasoning) a CSR Strategic Management Standard may work as a cognitive gap filling tool with respect to the firm's commitments and the stakeholders' expectations in presence of incomplete information. Moreover recent developments in the theory of conformist non-purely-self-interested preferences add motivational force to the basic result about self-enforcement of a CSR management standard. Hence, conformist preferences solve the problem of optimal mixed strategies that otherwise could enable the firm inducing the stakeholders to "trust" it without really conforming to a CSR standard. This result is given a formal proof in sec.11. The paper concludes with a collusion-proof design of intermediate social bodies (civil society institutions) that may answer the demand for assurance and external verifiability of CSR standards compliance by independent third.},

@article{Arminen2018,
abstract = {The past decades have experienced a growing interest in social and environmental issues, which has put more pressure on companies to meet diverse stakeholder expectations. These expectations encompass both inter-industry and international differences, highlighting the context-dependence of corporate social performance (CSP). Given the increased pressure to conduct business in a socially responsible manner, managers and policy-makers must understand the institutional factors that affect CSP but are not directly controllable. Despite this need, empirical studies of institutional effects are relatively rare and have mostly concentrated on a limited number of countries or industries. Moreover, informal institutions such as postmaterialistic values have not been adequately considered in the context of institutional research, although postmaterialism represents social change resulting in new social demands, which then cause more intense pressure on companies to improve their CSP. Our study accounts for postmaterialism and examines the institutional effects on CSP at both the national and industry levels in a sample of 6211 companies from 52 countries. To conduct this study, we utilized CSP information from the CSRHub database, which allowed us to analyse overall CSP and its four dimensions: community, employees, environment and governance. Our findings based on linear regression analyses indicate that country-level institutions are most strongly associated with CSP, and that the level of economic development and postmaterialistic values are positively related with the overall CSP and most of its dimensions. Also, company size and financial performance appear to affect CSP, while the evidence for the effect of industry impact is weak. Overall, there are both similarities and significant differences in the drivers of overall CSP and its dimensions. Understanding the determinants of CSP can improve understanding of how companies can contribute to sustainable development across nations and industries via sustainable business models (SBMs). Thus, our results may highlight the roles played by national governments in stimulating sustainable development in general and alternative SBMs in particular.},

It considers how the CSR concept, expanded from its focus on a few stakeholders, close at hand, to be more far reaching and inclusive, eventually becoming global in scope. In addition, it briefly considers what organizational activities and changes have taken place to accommodate these new initiatives, to the point at which it has become fully institutionalized today. It becomes apparent that today, well into the first decade of the 2000s, CSR in many firms is moving towards full integration with strategic management and corporate governance.},

This study develops and tests a conceptual framework, which predicts that (1) customer satisfaction partially mediates the relationship between CSR and firm market value (i.e., Tobin's q and stock return), (2) corporate abilities (innovativeness capability and product quality) moderate the financial returns to CSR, and (3) these moderated relationships are mediated by customer satisfaction. Based on a large-scale secondary data set, the results show support for this framework. Notably, the authors find that in firms with low innovativeness capability, CSR actually reduces customer satisfaction levels and, through the lowered satisfaction, harms market value. The uncovered mediated and asymmetrically moderated results offer important implications for marketing theory and practice},

The business case refers to the underlying arguments or rationales supporting or documenting why the business community should accept and advance the CSR 'cause'. The business case is concerned with the primary question: What do the business community and organizations get out of CSR? That is, how do they benefit tangibly from engaging in CSR policies, activities and practices? The business case refers to the bottom-line financial and other reasons for businesses pursuing CSR strategies and policies. In developing this business case, the paper first provides some historical background and perspective. In addition, it provides a brief discussion of the evolving understandings of CSR and some of the long-established, traditional arguments that have been made both for and against the idea of business assuming any responsibility to society beyond profit-seeking and maximizing its own financial well-being. Finally, the paper addresses the business case in more detail. The goal is to describe and summarize what the business case means and to review some of the concepts, research and practice that have come to characterize this developing idea. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and British Academy of Management.},

In practice, each CSR theory presents four dimensions related to profits, political performance, social demands and ethical values.

Surprisingly, firms in fact only sporadically pursue avoidance strategies, in contradiction to their own public announcements commonly made during policymaking to realize such strategies. The degree of regulatory uncertainty perceived and its interpretation as a threat increase the pursuit of most of these strategies.

abstract = {A meta-analysis of the comparative distance education (DE) literature between 1985 and 2002 was conducted. In total, 232 studies containing 688 indepen-dent achievement, attitude, and retention outcomes were analyzed. Overall results indicated effect sizes of essentially zero on all three measures and wide variability. This suggests that many applications of DE outperform their class-room counterparts and that many perform more poorly. Dividing achievement outcomes into synchronous and asynchronous forms of DE produced a some-what different impression. In general, mean achievement effect sizes for syn-chronous applications favored classroom instruction, while effect sizes for asynchronous applications favored DE. However, significant heterogeneity remained in each subset.},

abstract = {The focus of the present paper is on the contribution of the research in the student approaches to learning tradition. Several studies in this field have started from the assumption that students' approaches to learning develop towards more deep approaches to learning in higher education. This paper reports on a systematic review of longitudinal research on how students' approaches to learning develop during higher education. A total of 43 studies were included in the review. The results give an unclear picture of the development of approaches to learning and, thus, do not provide clear empirical evidence for the assumption that students develop towards more deep approaches during higher education. Neither methodological nor conceptual aspects of the studies investigated explained the ambiguity of the research results. Both theoretical and empirical implications for further research are discussed.},

abstract = {CPA exam pass rates are a widely accepted indicator of an accounting program's ability to prepare its graduates for success on the exam and are often used to communicate the quality of the program to prospective students. While passing the exam can be very expensive, time consuming, and difficult, it is a critical priority for most accounting students. This study examines (1) whether completion of a graduate degree is associated with performance on the CPA exam, and (2) the institutional variables that are also associated with CPA exam performance. These variables include the schools' accreditations, selectivity in admissions, faculty credentials, research ranking, and whether the school is public or private. The results indicated that completion of a graduate degree was associated with higher CPA exam pass rates. In addition, accreditation type, admissions selectivity, and proportion of accounting faculty holding a CPA license were also significantly associated with CPA exam pass rates. However, the proportion of accounting faculty with a terminal degree, research ranking, and public versus private were not significant.},

Two important contributions are made. First, the evidence suggests that, although many factors shape CPA, very few affect CPA to a large extent. Second, the results suggest that CPA is positively related to firm performance and is an important determinant of firm performance.

To create an environment that is more amenable to their businesses, the investors have pursued political risk management strategies. An analysis of those strategies in Bulgaria was undertaken on the basis of in-depth case-study research of American Standard, Metro Cash&Carry, and the Bulgarian International Business Association (BIBA), which represents many international firms in regard to political risk management in Bulgaria. The analysis shows that companies are pursuing two strategies-a low involvement strategy, in which companies, often working as part of a consortium, devote limited resources to mediation of a narrow set of political concerns, and a high involvement strategy, in which companies develop a diverse network of government, business, and public partners who can help them to mediate the political environment broadly. Investment intensity, a possible explanation of the different choice of strategy is considered. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a multilevel review of the literature on CSR in developing countries and highlights the key differentiators and nuanced CSR-related considerations that qualify it as a distinctive field of study. This review entails a content analysis of 452 articles spanning two-and-a-half decades (1990–2015). Based on this comprehensive review, the authors identify the key differentiating attributes of the literature on CSR in developing countries in relation to depictions of how CSR is conceived or ‘CSR Thinking' and depictions of how CSR is practiced and implemented or ‘CSR Doing'. The authors synthesize from there five key themes that capture the main aspects of variation in this literature, namely: (1) complex institutional antecedents within the national business system (NBS); (2) complex macro-level antecedents outside the NBS; (3) the salience of multiple actors involved in formal and informal governance; (4) hybridized and other nuanced forms of CSR expressions; and (5) varied scope of developmental and detrimental CSR consequences. The paper concludes by accentuating how the nuanced forms of CSR in the developing world are invariably contextualized and locally shaped by multi-level factors and actors embedded within wider formal and informal governance systems.},

This study proposes that an agency problem may occur between owners and managers in regard to firms' approach to corporate political strategy. Since a relational approach to corporate political strategy, such as establishing a government relations office in Washington, DC, requires significant resource commitments without guaranteeing a favorable policy change, shareholders might be reluctant to approve such an approach. In a sample of 3,417 U.S. manufacturing firms, over 5 years of data, the results show that institutional ownership and insider ownership are negatively associated with firms' propensity to engage in a relational approach to political strategy. {\textcopyright} 2012 SAGE Publications.},

However, the answer to the question has apparently not been found yet, at least that is what many researchers state. This apparent ambivalence in CSR consequences invites a literature study that can clarify the debate and allow for the drawing of conclusions. The results of the literature study performed here reveal that there is indeed clear empirical evidence for a positive correlation between corporate social and financial performance. Voices that state the opposite refer to out-dated material. Since the beginnings of the CSR debate, societies have changed. We can therefore clearly state that, for the present Western society, "Good Ethics is Good Business." {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We also develop a grounded framework for organizational structures for conflict resolution in the strategic management of government relations, based upon our case studies, and find a relationship between particular structures and the degree of diversification.

abstract = {Prior research has shown mixed results for the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate financial performance. Call for investigations on mediators and moderators have been put on notice to provide further explanations of previous mixed findings. This study responds to the calls for research by investigating the mediation effect of CSR outcomes, on the relationship between CSR governance and financial performance. We extract CSR governance and outcomes data from the Bloomberg environmental, social and governance (ESG) database and financial performance data from the COMPUSTAT database. Using a sample of 1980 firm-year observations from the top 500 Green companies in the United States for the years 2009 through 2013, we find that CSR outcomes mediate the relationships between CSR governance and financial performance. The results suggest that whether companies implement CSR governance successfully to generate good CSR outcomes plays an important role influencing companies' financial performance. The results of our study contribute to the CSR literature by providing an explanation of the mediation effects of actual CSR outcomes to the previous heterogeneous findings on CSR-financial return relationships.},

abstract = {Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has been adopted as an approach to international development. But who does it benefit and in what ways? Most importantly, does it allow certain interest groups to redefine the meaning of international development success? This article examines the historical relationship between business and development and compares how expectations of business as exemplified through CSR practices differ from those in the past. It then looks at the role and expectations of business in developing countries and proposes two tests for assessing if CSR makes a positive contribution to development goals based on whether it redefines the meaning of good business practice in the interests of the poor and marginalized, and if it helps development practitioners to manage more effectively the possibility and consequences of global capitalism for poor countries. The article argues that the interests of business are not adequately aligned with those of the poor, and explains why CSR does little to redress this. It argues that the business case in some instances overrides the developmental case for certain actions, and that business thinking is increasingly evident in the policies and practices of international development. Although CSR may have a positive contribution to make in some circumstances, its limitations need to be understood if development's case for involving business is not to be subsumed by business reasons for engaging with (and by-passing) developing countries.},

CSR is an idea whose time has arrived, not just in the United States but wherever markets and corporate enterprise comprise the foundation of a society's economic endeavors. Unevenly developed and experienced across the grand arc of 21st century societies, CSR is infiltrating into corporate consciousness and corporate culture, finds expression in the workplace, sparks stakeholder involvement, molds company strategy, enriches the quality of community life, broadens business vision, and seeks to humanize economic enterprise wherever it is found. A cardinal principle of CSR's spread throughout the globe is that each society and each business firm shall find its own unique way of expressing and realizing CSR's core meaning.},

abstract = {While there are growing bodies of research examining both the differences between strongly and poorly socially performing firms, and the impact of firm leaders on other strategic outcomes, little has been done in examining the effect of firm leaders on corporate social performance (CSP). This study directly addresses this issue by using upper echelon theory, and the KLD Research Analytics CSP ratings, to show that observable CEO characteristics predict differences in CSP between firms, even when firm and industry characteristics are controlled for. Using a sample of 650 public US firms I find that strong or exemplary CSP, as measured by the strengths categories of KLD's ratings, is positively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in humanities, having a breadth of career experience and being female. I find that KLD strength ratings are negatively related to the CEO having a bachelor's degree in economics and to their level of short-term compensation. Preliminary tests of causality support the assertion that these effects reflect CEO discretion rather than being an artifact of reverse causality. Significant relationships between the CEO characteristics and poor social performance as measured by the concerns categories of KLD's ratings are not found. This suggests that CEOs have more discretion in influencing strong and exemplary social performance than in impacting poor CSP. Implications, particularly for economics education, are discussed. While there are many fruitful directions for future research, the benefits and challenges to conducting similar studies in other countries is focused upon to correspond to the global nature of this special issue. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

In particular, the reported results indicate a positive relationship between the presence of female CEOs or Chairs and firm performance, thus suggesting that gender-based differences may affect the CEO's/Chairperson's success. Moreover, the findings concerning the age of the CEO or Chair are mixed, while their experience and quality appear positively related to firm performance.

abstract = {Interest groups seek to influence economic activity through public and private politics. Public politics takes place in the arena of public institutions, whereas private politics takes place outside public institutions often in the arena of public sentiment. Private politics refers to action by interest groups directed at private parties, as in the case of an activist group launching a campaign against a firm. This paper presents a model of informational competition between an activist and an industry, where both interest groups seek to influence public sentiment and do so by advocating their positions through the news media. Citizen consumers make both a private consumption decision and a collective choice on the regulation of a product that has an externality associated with it. In the absence of the news organization, the collective choice is not to regulate. The activist and the industry obtain private, hard information on the seriousness of the externality and provide favorable information to the news media and may conceal unfavorable information. The news media can conduct investigative journalism to obtain its own information, and based on that information and the information it has received from its sources, provides a news report to the public. Because of its role in society, the media has an incentive to bias its report, and the direction of bias is toward regulation. Its bias serves to mitigate both market failure by decreasing demand and a government failure by shifting votes in favor of regulation.

abstract = {Activist NGOs have increasingly foregone public politics and turned to private politics to change the practices of firms and industries. This paper focuses on private politics, activist strategies, and nonmarket strategies of targets. A formal theory of an encounter between an activist organization and a target is presented to examine strategies for lessening the chance of being a target and for addressing an activist challenge once it has occurred. The encounter between the activist and the target is viewed as competition. At the heart of that competition is an activist campaign, which is represented by a demand, a promised reward if the target meets the demand, and a threat of harm if the target rejects the demand. The model incorporates target selection by the activist, proactive measures and reputation building by a potential target to reduce the likelihood of being selected as a target, fighting a campaign, and credible commitment. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Corporate social responsibility is moving higher up the board-room agenda as concern for the environment grows in society at large. But should strategies for environmental sustainability be implemented for their own sake? What are the effects on corporate financial performance of going down this road-or of ignoring it? How can managers be guided through the trade-offs that ultimately must be made and assess how social performance impacts on overall long-term corporate profitability? This article presents a framework that describes the drivers of corporate social performance, the actions that managers can take to affect that performance, and the consequences of those actions on both corporate social and financial performance. Illustrated with references to strategies currently employed by corporations, the authors examine the effects of sustainability strategies on various corporation stakeholders from investors to employees, consumers and the community at large. Showing how companies are increasingly interested in gaining lasting strategic advantage through examining and improving relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, the authors argue that, as external costs become increasingly assignable, forward-looking corporate leadership requires reporting and assessment of both current and potential social and environmental impacts. The framework they present allows for the more careful understanding of both the drivers of social performance and the impacts of that performance on the various corporate stakeholders, permitting better integration of that information into the day-to-day operational decisions and the institutionalization of social concerns throughout the organization.},

Further, we hypothesize that smaller firms will show a stronger negative relationship than larger firms. CEO survey data from a sample of 630 Chinese private firms confirm the moderating role of firm size. However, the results are not entirely as expected. The negative relationship is observed in small firms (100 or fewer employees), but the relationship is positive for large firms (greater than 1000 employees), consistent with the literature.

We propose that CEOs' political ideologies will influence their firms' corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices, hypothesizing that (1) liberal CEOs will emphasize CSR more than will conservative CEOs; (2) the association between a CEO's political ideology and CSR will be amplified by a CEO's relative power; and (3) liberal CEOs will emphasize CSR even when recent financial performance is low, whereas conservative CEOs will pursue CSR initiatives only as performance allows. We test our ideas with a sample of 249 CEOs, measuring their ideologies by coding their political donations over the ten years prior to their becoming CEOs. Results indicate that the political ideologies of CEOs are manifested in their firms' CSR profiles. Compared with conservative CEOs, liberal CEOs exhibit greater advances in CSR; the influence of CEOs' political liberalism on CSR is amplified when they have more power; and liberal CEOs' CSR initiatives are less contingent on recent performance than are those of conservative CEOs. In a corroborative exploration, we find that CEOs' political ideologies are significantly related to their corporate political action committee (PAC) allocations, indicating that this largely unexplored executive attribute might be more widely consequential. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

Using a greatly improved source of data on corporate social performance, this paper reports the results of a rigorous study of the empirical linkages between financial and social performance. Corporate social performance (CSP) is found to be positively associated with prior financial performance, supporting the theory that slack resource availability and CSP are positively related.

We then present a typology of firm responsiveness and suggest that firms will respond more substantially to those issues perceived as salient to both cognitive logics and more symbolically to those issues perceived as salient to only one logic.

A theoretical framework is developed in order to explain the access of business interests to the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The degree of access to these institutions is explained in terms of a theory of demand and supply of access goods. Access goods concern information that is crucial in the EU policy-making process. In order to gain access to an EU institution, business interests have to provide the access good(s) demanded by that institution. Organizational form is introduced as the innovative unit of analysis. It follows that associative business action is unconventionally studied in relation to two other organizational forms: individual company action and third-party representation.},

This revised perspective offers a better understanding of stakeholder networks where (1) value exchange has become complex rather than dyadic, (2) tension between stakeholder interests has become explicit rather than implicit, and (3) control over marketing activities has become dispersed rather than centralized. The paper conceptualizes capabilities required by firms for dealing with each of these three transitions: systems thinking, paradoxical thinking, and democratic thinking. The paper discusses implications for firm performance, marketing theory, empirical research, and marketing practice and argues that embracing stakeholder marketing helps to reclaim territory for marketing in academia and business.},

Grundfest [1993. Just vote no: a minimalist strategy for dealing with barbarians inside the gates. Stanford Law Review 45, 857-937] argues that a substantial withheld vote motivates directors to take immediate action to avoid further embarrassment. We find a variety of supportive evidence, including operating performance improvements and abnormal disciplinary chief executive officer (CEO) turnover, indicating that such campaigns induce boards to take actions in shareholders' interests. Furthermore, abnormal turnover is robust to controlling for concurrent events and firm- and CEO-specific controls. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Reijsbergen2016,
abstract = {One of the main applications of probabilisticmodel checking is to decide whether the probability of a property of interest is above or below a threshold. Using statistical model checking (SMC), this is done using a combination of stochastic simulation and statistical hypothesis testing. When the probability of interest is very small, one may need to resort to rare-event simulation techniques, in particular importance sampling (IS). However, IS simulation does not yield 0/1-outcomes, as assumed by the hypothesis tests commonly used in SMC, but likelihood ratios that are typically close to zero, but which may also take large values. In this paper we consider two possible ways of combining IS and SMC. One involves a classical IS-scheme from the rare-event simulation literature that yields likelihood ratios with bounded support when applied to a certain (nontrivial) class of models. The other involves a particular hypothesis testing scheme that does not require a-priori knowledge about the samples, only that their variance is estimated well.},

abstract = {Environmental management has the potential to play a pivotal role in the financial performance of the firm. Many individuals suggest that profitability is hurt by the higher production costs of environmental management initiatives, while others cite anecdotal evidence of increased profitability. A theoretical model is proposed that links strong environmental management to improved perceived future financial performance, as measured by stock market performance. The linkage to firm performance is tested empirically using financial event methodology and archival data of firm-level environmental and financial performance. Significant positive returns were measured for strong environmental management as indicated by environmental performance awards, and significant negative returns were measured for weak environmental management as indicated by environmental crises. The implicit financial market valuation of these events also was estimated. Cross-sectional analysis of the environmental award events revealed differences for first-time awards and between industries. First-time award announcements were associated with greater increases in market valuation, although smaller increases were observed for firms in environmentally dirty industries, possibly indicative of market skepticism. This linkage between environmental management and financial performance can be used by both researchers and practitioners as one measure of the benefits experienced by industry leaders, and as one criterion against which to measure investment alternatives.},

We report on a study that relates the market value of firms in the S&P 500 to objective measures of their environmental performance. After controlling for variables traditionally thought to explain firm-level financial performance, we find that bad environmental performance is negatively correlated with the intangible asset value of firms. The average "intangible liability" for firms in our sample is $380 million - approximately 9% of the replacement value of tangible assets. We conclude that legally emitted toxic chemicals have a significant effect on the intangible asset value of publicly traded companies. A 10% reduction in emissions of toxic chemicals results in a $34 million increase in market value. The magnitude of these effects varies across industries, with larger losses accruing to the traditionally polluting industries.},

Applying the strategic logic of the Bartlett and Ghoshal typology to the realm of CSR, multinational firms should respond to pressures for integration and responsiveness from salient stakeholders. However, an institutional logic would suggest that multinational firms will simply replicate the existing product-market organizational strategy (multidomestic, transnational, global) in their management of CSR. These alternative approaches are tested with a survey instrument sent to MNEs operating in Mexico. The results of this study are consistent with the proposition that institutional pressures, rather than strategic analysis of social issues and stakeholders, are guiding decision-making with respect to CSR. We develop implications for MNE management and research, as well as public policy. {\textcopyright} 2006 Academy of International Business. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study investigates financial correlates of corporate philanthropy in Fortune 1000 companies using structural equation modeling. The results suggest that cash flow (one of the most discretionary types of organizational slack) has a significant impact on a firm's cash donations to charitable causes, but monetary donations do not affect firm financial performance. These findings support the accepted view of corporate philanthropy as a discretionary social responsibility and the traditional thinking about firm giving in the business and society literature—that doing well enables doing good. Contrary to some contemporary thinking, the findings imply no significant effect on profits from corporate generosity. {\textcopyright} 2004, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

Firms operate and take strategic actions in both the market and nonmarket environment, the latter including firm interactions with the government. The research presented here argues that for reasons of risk aversion, firms facing declining performance below aspiration levels are likely to engage in strategic actions in the nonmarket environment immediately following a performance shortfall. In contrast, risk-taking preferences are argued to motivate firms to take strategic actions in the market environment in the future. We find support for these arguments utilizing 27 years of data from large U.S. firms.},

This article combines ideas from Upper Echelons Theory with research in corporate political activity to bridge this important gap.

@article{Rahaman2011,
abstract = {Why do some firms grow faster than others? Although various observed and unobserved aspects of firms have been suggested as potential drivers of firm heterogeneity, economists disagree sharply on the role of financial structure in influencing firm growth. In this paper, I use a sample of quoted and unquoted firms to show that the effect of financial structure on firm growth is statistically significant and quantitatively important. In the presence of external financing constraints, firms rely more on internal funds to finance growth, but the effect of internal financing on firm growth decreases with an increase in the firm's access to an external bank credit facility. As the external financing constraint is alleviated, the firm relies less on internal funds and switches to external financing as the primary source of financing for its growth. This pattern of transition between internal and external financing is particularly pronounced in small unquoted firms (conditional on their survival). These results suggest a real effect of financial structure on growth via the channel of an external financing constraint. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, we undertake an analysis of the relationship between corporate reputation and the dynamics of financial performance using two complementary dynamic models.

abstract = {Emerging markets experience institutional and social changes over time that present different stakeholder expectations for multinational corporations (MNCs). MNCs are often accused of social misdeeds and experience public crises during the changes, leaving questions on how they adapt to the local social transition to sustain operations. Conventional adaptation strategies put too much emphasis on maximizing economic returns by arbitraging national differences and catering to local market and consumer characteristics. The economic orientation may fail to address evolving and diverse stakeholder expectations, easily leading to public crises. This study conceptualizes economic adaptation and social adaptation as two sets of knowledge and capabilities that would have equally important impacts on MNCs' sustainable operations in emerging markets. The empirical testing examines consumer rights-related public crises experienced by 180 MNCs in China. The results suggest that MNCs' social adaptation activities have significantly positive effects in mitigating public crises while certain aspects of economic adaption, such as early entry into China, reliance on local leadership, and speedy expansion of local employees, lead to public crises. The significant interaction effects confirm that MNCs need to follow a balanced approach, paying attention to both economic and social components to avoid public crises and sustain growth in emerging markets. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academy of International Business.},

The purpose of this paper is threefold. First, it aims to demonstrate systematically how political connections affect entrepreneurial reinvestment. Second, it applies this relationship to a subsample group, i.e., Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), in order to empirically test whether political connections are more beneficial for large firms or SMEs. Third, it demonstrates that political connections substitute for, rather than complement, formal market and legal institutions.

In this case, one environmental group attempted to act as a bridge between business and environmentalists by endorsing a line of “green” products. Based on material drawn from news reports and personal interviews, the authors use the case to illuminate the concept of strategic bridging as a distinctive form of collaboration. Like other forms of collaboration, bridging relies on collaborative negotiations and “back-home” commitment to the outcome of the negotiations and “back-home” commitment to the outcome of the negotiations. It differs from other forms -such as joint ventures, multiparty task forces, and mediation -with respect to the degree of organizational interpenetration involved in the negotiations and the complexity of the problem of gaining back-home commitment. Based on their analysis, the authors speculate that strategic bridging is more likely to occur when the problem domain is underorganized and the willingness of the stakeholders to collaborate is low. Implications for future research are discussed. {\textcopyright} 1991, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Small and medium-sized firms form 90% of the worldwide population of businesses. However, it has been argued that given their smaller scale of operations, resource access constraints and lower visibility, smaller firms are less likely to participate in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. This article examines the different economic motivations of firms with varying combinations of visibility, resource access and scale of operations. Arguments are presented to propose that in terms of visibility, resource access and operating scale, very small and very large firms are equally motivated to participate in CSR. However, the motivational bases for CSR participation are likely to be different. Medium-sized firms are the least motivated. This suggests a U-shaped relationship between firm size and CSR participation. This study contributes towards resolution of the long-standing debate on the effects of firm size on CSR participation, and highlights the importance of considering configurations of firm characteristics in the study of CSR outcomes. In conclusion, cautions are raised against the broad categorization of firms, without adequate attention to the underlying dimensions of such categorizations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the determinants of corporate charitable donations within a comparative study of corporate behaviour in two time periods, 1989-90 and 1998-99. The analysis is based on a longitudinal data set that includes over 400 UK listed companies. The determinants of corporate charitable donations are explored within a stakeholder model and the relationship between corporate charitable donations and a set of firm and industry variables is estimated using OLS. Particular emphasis is placed on industry effects and the impact of social and environmental stakeholders. The results highlight a significant change in behaviour between 1989-90 and 1998-99 that may reflect a strategic response by corporate decision-makers to external concerns over corporate social responsibility. In the early period corporate charitable donations were substantially determined by profits. However, this relationship has weakened during the 1990s as firms have become increasingly responsive to stakeholder influences. The results for the later period emphasize the increasing importance of corporate visibility, and the development of social and environmental influences on corporate charitable contributions.},

Drawing on the community development literature, the author sought to improve the conceptualization of collaboration among organizations beyond approaches found in the interorganizational literature. A classification of three development patterns -the individual, segmental, and common -basedon an increasing level of shared decision making among participating organizations provided the framework for an action research project involving 148small nonprofit organizations in the Philadelphia area. For 4 years key actors mobilized a network of resource exchange relations among the managers of these organizations, forming the Delaware Valley Council of Agencies. This proved to be an essential catalyst for both a more developed organizational community and an increased ability to manage shared resources within the environment. The lessons learned from the project are formulated into a set of intervention guidelines, and implications for similar types of settings are presented. {\textcopyright} 1991, Sage Publications.

Using CSP data from 2190 firms in three major industries from the Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini, Inc. database in 2007, our study presents the first application of the DEA model for CSP and ordinal data and opens up a new path for future empirical CSP research. {\textcopyright} 2010 Production and Operations Management Society.},

abstract = {This paper provides initial empirical analysis of the content and structure of the corporate integrated reports published as at January 2013 on the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) Emerging Examples Database. Its aim is to provide insights into the early stage development of this new reporting mode. Integrated reports were analysed for company information, report information and report content, and evaluated as to the extent these adhere to the integrated reporting (IR) Guiding Principles, Content Elements, and the Multiple Capitals model. The analysis is informed by neo-institutional theory which underlies the evaluation of the extent of isomorphism identified in early industry adoption of IR. Our study finds that early integrated reports are in general lengthy rather than concise, but fail to adhere to all the Guiding Principles. Their focus emphasizes soft (general) measures like Strategy, Operating Context and Organisational Overview rather than hard (specific) measures like Performance and Future Outlook, with a generally low level of responsiveness to the principle of Stakeholder Inclusiveness. The reports cover four of the six capitals suggested. A significant finding is that early IR is not dominated by high social and environmental impact industries as suggested in current literature, but by the financial services industry. This study is important as it provides an understanding of the early stages of the development of IR, a new mode of reporting that represents a fundamental shift away from the traditional focus of financial reporting, and which is likely in future to become mandated in some form for large corporate entities with public accountability.},

abstract = {Purpose This paper is motivated by the International Integrated Reporting Council?s (IIRC) call for feedback from all stakeholders with knowledge of the International Integrated Reporting Framework <IRF>, and specifically of the enablers, incentives and barriers to its implementation. The paper synthesises insights from contemporary accounting research into integrated reporting (IR) as a general concept, and integrated reporting <IR> as espoused by the IIRC in the <IRF> (IIRC, 2013). We specifically focus on possible barriers and emphasise the specific issues we feel could be rectified to advance the <IRF>, along with the areas that may potentially hinder wider adoption and implementation. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws upon and synthesises academic analysis and insights provided in the IR and <IR> academic literature as well as various directives, policy and framework pronouncements. Findings The flexibility and lack of prescription concerning actual disclosures and metrics in the <IRF> could allow it to be used for compliance, regardless of the other benefits lauded by the IIRC. Thus we see forces, both external and internal, driving <IR> adoption, with one prominent example being the European Union Directive on non-financial reporting. Because of the different ways in which IR is understood and enacted, there are numerous theoretical and empirical challenges for academics. Our paper highlights potential areas for further robust academic research, and the need to contribute to <IR> policy and practice. Research limitations/implications The paper provides the IIRC, academics, regulators and reporting organisations with insights into current practice and the <IR> framework. We highlight the need for further development and evidence to help inform improvements both from a policy and a practice perspective. A key limitation of our work is that we draw upon a synthesis of the existing literature which is still in an early stage of development. Originality/value The paper provides the IIRC with several insights into the current <IRF>, and specifically with the enablers, incentives and barriers to its implementation. Also, it provides academic researchers with a number of important observations and an agenda upon which they can build their future research.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to critically assess integrated reporting so as to “broaden out” and “open up” dialogue and debate about how accounting and reporting standards might assist or obstruct efforts to foster sustainable business practices. Design/methodology/approach – The authors link current debates about integrated reporting to prior research on the contested politics of social and environmental reporting, and critiques of the dominance of business case framings. The authors introduce research from science and technology studies that seeks to broaden out and open up appraisal methods and engagement processes in ways that highlight divergent framings and politically contentious issues, in an effort to develop empowering designs for sustainability. The authors demonstrate the strong resonance between this work and calls for the development of dialogic/polylogic accountings that take pluralism seriously by addressing constituencies and perspectives currently marginalized in mainstream accounting. The authors draw and build on both literatures to critically reflect on the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC, 2011, 2012a, b, 2013a, b) advocacy of a business case approach to integrated reporting as an innovation that can contribute to sustainability transitions. Findings – The authors argue that integrated reporting, as conceived by the IIRC, provides a very limited and one-sided approach to assessing and reporting on sustainability issues.While the business case framing on which it rests might assist in extending the range of phenomena accounted for in organizational reports, it remains an ideologically closed approach that is more likely to reinforce rather than encourage critical reflection on “business as usual” practices. Recognizing that the meaning and design of integrated reporting are still far from stabilized, the authors also illustrate more enabling possibilities aimed at identifying and engaging diverse socio-political perspectives. Practical implications – Science and technology studies research on the need to broaden out and open up appraisal methods, together with proposals for dialogic/polylogic accountings, facilitates a critical, nuanced discussion of the value of integrated reporting as a change initiative that might foster transitions to more sustainable business practices. Originality/value – The authors link ideas and findings from science and technology studies with literature on dialogic/polylogic accountings to engage current debates around the merits of integrated reporting as a change initiative that can contribute to sustainability. This paper advances understanding of the role of accounting in sustainability transitions in three main ways: first, it takes discussion of accounting change beyond the organizational level, where much professional and academic literature is currently focussed, and extends existing critiques of business case approaches to social and environmental reporting; second, it emphasizes the political and power-laden nature of appraisal processes, dimensions that are under-scrutinized in existing accounting literature; and third, it introduces a novel framework that enables evaluation of individual disclosure initiatives such as integrated reporting without losing sight of the big picture of sustainability challenges.},

A background to the development of the <IR> concept over the 4‐year period from the inception of the IIRC in 2010 is provided, culminating in the release by the IIRC of a Consultation Draft (CD) of the <IR> framework in March 2013. Second, the paper discusses key issues currently being debated relating to the CD that the IIRC will need to resolve prior to the expected release of their <IR> framework in late 2013. This discussion is based on issues identified and reported to the IIRC by a subcommittee of the International Association for Accounting Education and Research (IAAER) comprised of international accounting academics. Finally, the paper identifies a range of potential research issues relating to the development and implementation of <IR>.},

@article{Haller2014,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the current discussions about the concept of Integrated Reporting (IR) and provides a practical and useful proposal of an instrument that could help to apply the IR concept in corporate practice. Design/methodology/approach – The study uses a deductive normative research approach. Findings – Based on a comprehensive review of international literature and research, the paper argues that a structured presentation of the traditional measure of “value added” in a so-called “value added statement” (VAS) has the potential to serve as a practical and effective reporting instrument for IR. The proposed VAS not only meets the guiding principles of IR but also reports on the monetary effects of different types of capital included in IR and in this way complements and represents the concept of IR very well. Research limitations/implications – The authors intend to stimulate the academic as well as institutional discussion on howto apply the concept of IR at the corporate level. As the characteristics of the proposedVAS complywellwith the guiding principles and concepts developed in the Integrated Reporting Framework project of the International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) andwith the ultimate objective of integrated thinking, the study can inform the current considerations within and outside of the IIRC. Originality/value – The future of IR and the probability of its world-wide application in practice will depend on the development of appropriate reporting tools that incorporate the central ideas of IR, currently no such reporting tools exist. In this paper the authors make an argument for a VAS as a complementing, useful and therefore appropriate reporting tool for IR.},

@article{Stubbs2014,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to investigate the internal mechanisms employed by early adopters of integrated reporting in Australia to manage their reporting process and explores whether integrated reporting is stimulating innovative disclosure mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach – The study was based on in-depth semi-structured interviews with organisations in varying stages of implementing integrated reporting. In total, 23 interviews were conducted with sustainability managers, finance managers and communications managers across 15 organisations. A content analysis of the interviews was undertaken using qualitative coding techniques. Findings – While the organisations that are producing some form of integrated report are changing their processes and structures, or at least talking about it, their adoption of integrated reporting has not necessarily stimulated new innovations in disclosure mechanisms. This study did not uncover radical, transformative change to reporting processes, but rather incremental changes to processes and structures that previously supported sustainability reporting. Research limitations/implications – A major limitation of this research study was the small sample of organisations and stakeholders that participated, and the single-country focus. Finance, accounting and strategy people were particularly under-represented in this study, as well as external stakeholders, and the conclusions can only be tentative until further tested. Practical implications – This paper sheds light on the practices of early adopters of integrated reporting, and their learning could inform other organisations considering an integrated reporting approach. Originality/value – As an emerging phenomenon, there are few empirical studies exploring integrated reporting practices and this paper provides some insights into integrated reporting in Australia.},

However, there has only been limited research into why this has occurred. This study examines how the preparer-focused accounting textbooks adopted by New Zealand universities contribute to these concerns. Given that three of the five adopted textbooks are authorised adaptations of American textbooks and one is an American textbook, these findings will have implications for educators and authors beyond New Zealand. In an effort to better reflect accounting practice, this paper calls on authors and publishers of textbooks to acknowledge the wider context within which accounting operates, and the influence of technology on the accounting process as currently practised.},

abstract = {Purpose: Given the country-specific characteristics of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there is an increasing interest in studying CSR in developing countries. Such studies play an important role in broadening people's knowledge of CSR under different economic, social and cultural conditions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the CSR reports (CSRRs) of listed companies in the largest emerging market, namely China. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a content analysis of 81 CSRRs (2007) of listed companies in domestic security markets of China (the Shanghai Security Exchanges and Shenzhen Security Exchange), the CSR features of Chinese companies are thoroughly evaluated. Findings: The main findings of the study are as follows. Only 5.05 percent of listed companies published their CSRRs in China, and 4.42 percent of them issued a separate CSRR. Most companies (97.18 percent) use "CSRR" as the name of their stand-alone CSRRs; 79 percent of companies hold a positive attitude to taking on social responsibilities, while no company holds a negative attitude. Various social issues and stakeholders of companies are addressed in CSRRs. In general, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher propensity to address most of social issues, which may reflect that SOEs are more politically sensitive than non-SOEs because most of the social issues are just "political slogans" proposed by the Chinese Government in recent years. However, non-SOEs have better performance than SOEs in addressing the interests of stakeholders. Meanwhile, industrial firms show higher propensity to address the interests of stakeholders than service firms. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study indicate that CSR reporting practice is still at an early stage of development in China. Meanwhile, Chinese companies tend to follow the Chinese guidelines in issuing CSRRs rather than adopt international guidelines. In addition, Chinese companies are somewhat politically sensitive in addressing social issues. A major weakness of this study is that the sample only represents the best companies in assuming social responsibilities in China, thus some results cannot be generalized to all Chinese companies. Originality/value: The paper helps people, especially Westerners, to comprehend CSR in China. To the author's knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to examine CSR in China. {\textcopyright} Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {We study institutional entrepreneurship in an emergent field by analyzing the case of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and its efforts to purposefully institutionalize the practice of sustainability reporting. We suggest that analogies affect institutionalization processes through two mechanisms. In the early stages of institutionalization, analogy operates primarily as a normative mechanism, and adoption is driven mainly by an instrumental logic. This emphasis on similarity to existing institutions stresses conformity and promotes legitimacy. Yet analogies can also have a cognitive effect on institutional design, especially once initial acceptance from the environment has been secured, by directing attention toward incongruences between the emergent institution and its analogical source. Institutional entrepreneurship can spur innovation and departure from existing institutions by highlighting limitations of the analogical source and providing a compelling value-rational argument that underscores the worth of the new institution. This theoretical contribution helps explain how analogies to existing institutional practices can both provide legitimacy to novel institutions and constitute the basis for a creative process of institutional design. {\textcopyright} 2010 INFORMS.},

abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous nature of the discourse on human rights there is currently little research on the emergence of disclosure by multinational corporations on their human rights obligations or the regulatory dynamic that may lie behind this trend. In an attempt to begin to explore the extent to which, if any, the language of human rights has entered the discourse of corporate accountability, this paper investigates the adoption of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) human rights standards by major multinational garment retail companies that source products from developing countries, as disclosed through their reporting media. The paper has three objectives. Firstly, to empirically explore the extent to which a group of multinational garment retailers invoke the language of human rights when disclosing their corporate responsibilities. The paper reviews corporate reporting media including social responsibility codes of conduct, annual reports and stand-alone social responsibility reports released by 18 major global clothing and retail companies during a period from 1990 to 2007. We find that the number of companies adopting and disclosing on the ILO's workplace human rights standards has significantly increased since 1998 - the year in which the ILO's standards were endorsed and accepted by the global community (ILO, 1998). Secondly, drawing on a combination of Responsive Regulation theory and neo-institutional theory, we tentatively seek to understand the regulatory space that may have influenced these large corporations to adopt the language of human rights obligations. In particular, we study the role that International Governmental Organisation's (IGO) such as ILO may have played in these disclosures. Finally, we provide some critical reflections on the power and potential within the corporate adoption of the language of human rights. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

We suggest a two-step analytic framework where (1) circulated generalized assumptive logics relevant to mainstream CSR understanding are translated for applicability to developing countries generally and (2) through further circulation these translated logics are adapted toward a more context-specific relevant and meaningful application of CSR. Translation and adaptation form the basis of ongoing “editing processes” which we use to help tease out the multiplicity of institutional logics captured in the CSR literature pertaining to four specific countries of interest: China, India, Nigeria and Lebanon. The nuanced analysis presented helps provide relevant implications in relation to supranational, as well as culturally embedded and nuanced institutional logics shaping CSR in developing countries. It also highlights the existence of a hybridity of entangled institutional logics shaping not only CSR expressions in the four focal developing countries, but also ensuing patterns of development.},

However, the quality and the contents of information disclosure have yet to be translated into meaningful and comprehensive reports. This article proposed a framework to evaluate the quality and the contents of the voluntary information disclosure of sustainability reports in Taiwan. The proposed framework is based on the Global Reporting Initiative G3 Guideline, scorecard, and other award scoring systems that were converted into comprehensive scoring systems to evaluate 16 reports published by companies operating in Taiwan. In all, 44 indicators within 18 criteria were recognized through expert questionnaires and the fuzzy Delphi method. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process was applied to determine the relative weightings of the 18 criteria, after which a multiple-criteria decision-making evaluation framework was launched for scoring sustainability reports. An illustrative example in the 2009 Taiwan Corporate Sustainability Reports Award is presented to demonstrate the process of choosing the best reports. Not only can the proposed model within country level assess the quality and the contents of sustainability reports, but also it can promote voluntary information disclosure in Taiwan. {\textcopyright} Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract = {This study explores corporate social responsibility (CSR) by conducting a cross-cultural analysis of communication of CSR activities in a total of 16 U.S. and European corporations. Drawing on previous research contrasting two major approaches to CSR initiatives, it was proposed that U.S. companies would tend to communicate about and justify CSR using economic or bottom-line terms and arguments whereas European companies would rely more heavily on language or theories of citizenship, corporate accountability, or moral commitment. Results supported this expectation of difference, with some modification. Specifically, results indicated that EU companies do not value sustainability to the exclusion of financial elements, but instead project sustainability commitments in addition to financial commitments. Further, U.S.-based companies focused more heavily on financial justifications whereas EU-based companies incorporated both financial and sustainability elements in justifying their CSR activities. In addition, wide variance was found in both the prevalence and use of specific CSR-related terminology. Cross-cultural distinctions in this use create implications with regard to measurability and evidence of both strategic and bottom-line impact.

abstract = {The focus of the paper is on consideration of how to use indicators to monitor sustainable development in a relevant and useful manner. Integrated information on sustainable development of a company is very essential for decision-making since it is very difficult to evaluate the performance of the company on the ground of too many indicators. The objective of the work was to design a model for obtaining a composite sustainable development index (I CSD) in order to track integrated information on economic, environmental, and social performance of the company with time. Normalized indicators were associated into three sustainability sub-indices and finally composed into an overall indicator of a company performance. This was applied by determining the impact of individual indicator to the overall sustainability of a company using the concept of analytic hierarchy process. The demonstration of the model used data for a case study company, Henkel, and a set of sustainable development indicators that were classified using the currently most widely accepted approach of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Case study was used to measure I CSD and sustainability sub-indices of the company over the time interval of 6 years. Interpretation of results is given and the utility of I CSD with its relevance for decision-making is pointed out. Using a case study, the paper demonstrates that the model can be applied to deliver composite indicators of sustainability performance of companies. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The discrepancy between the high importance of intangibles and the general inability to measure and account for these types of assets constitutes a growing challenge for business and society, in particular within the framework of Non-Financial Reporting. Traditional financial reporting typically does not provide good predictions of future financial performance. The malfunctioning of risk capital markets partly depends on the lack of reliable information on intangibles. Thus, measurements of intangibles must be significantly improved. The information on intangibles needs to be based on the right measurements, it needs to be comparable (i.e. based on common guidelines, or even standards), and it needs to be verifiable and understood by the users. This paper reviews the situation with reference to measuring intangibles for non-financial reporting. It comments on various related research projects and R&D activities initiated by accounting organizations. It emphasizes the possible importance of various Best Practice measurement programs, such as ACSI and EPSI Rating.

abstract = {Recently, corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming widely recognized as an issue for Japanese companies. Corporate responsibility for employees is considered important by various stakeholders, and occupational safety and health is regarded as one of these responsibilities. The present authors examined this issue from the viewpoint of corporate management by analysis of statements found in CSR-related reports. For companies listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), we searched for CSR-related reports, and titles and contents, based on two established guidelines: the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines 2002 as the international reference and the Environmental Reporting Guidelines of the Ministry of the Environment, Government of Japan, as the domestic reference. Corporations that published CSR reports were 26.3% (416/1,581) of the total, and large differences were recognized by type of industry. Comparing the numbers of pages for various contents, more concern was shown about the environment than about social activity, indicating the environment to be the main issue of CSR in Japan. In the items included in the guidelines, many matters about occupational accidents were mentioned, but it was found that statements regarding HIV/AIDS, which is not of such strong social concern in Japan, and statements regarding the costs of safety that are difficult to calculate were few. However, statements regarding mental health, which is of high interest socially, were many, even though this issue is not included in the two guidelines used. In revising the guidelines, these matters should be reviewed. In the future, continuance of analysis of CSR-related reports with regard to changes and comparisons with overseas reports will help improve occupational safety and health.},

abstract = {In recent years, corporate social responsibility (CSR) of Multinational Corporations (MNCs) in developing countries has received more attention. However, in this literature, Africa is much less well represented than other regions, and existing studies about Africa have mainly focused on South Africa and Nigeria. This focus has resulted in scant research on other African countries where MNCs are located as well, and where their presence is notable. Settings largely unexplored include conflict-ridden areas in Central Africa where a limited number of usually large MNCs can potentially have a large impact on the local situation and play a role in addressing the huge problems with which these countries are confronted. Moreover, the MNCs themselves face large CSR dilemmas, related to the contribution they can (or cannot) give in the different setting compared to their home countries as well as their attitude vis-{\`{a}}-vis ongoing conflicts. In order to help shed light on these issues, this article explores how MNCs report on CSR and conflict in three Central African countries (Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Republic of the Congo). Our analysis of company information reveals that opportunities are widely seen and that most MNCs report on their economic and social impacts. However, CSR reporting is fairly generic, and the specific context seems to bear little influence on the type of CSR activities. The conflict dimension also receives limited attention, although some companies show awareness and outline the limitations of their power and the dilemmas inherent to their presence in these countries. The potential for MNCs' involvement in (co)creating sustainable economies is recognised, and needs further research attention in the coming years. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Based on a theoretical exploration in a previous article, this paper empirically analyzes which issues of SD are taken into account by corporations and stakeholders in what way, and to what extent the concept of sustainable development (SD) can be achieved through stakeholder relations management (SRM) on the corporate level. An important basis for this empirical analysis is a referential framework, which specifies 14 issues of SD. In a first empirical step, the literature-based framework has been operationalized for the business world by analyzing sustainability reports. In a second empirical step, the operationalized framework served as the basis for a survey of selected MNCs. The analyses of the sustainability reports and the survey show how MNCs deal with particular issues of SD and what role they perceive particular stakeholders play. A key conclusion of the article is that SRM indeed promotes SD, but that it is no alternative to predictable government regulation. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {Although it is now widely recognised by business leaders that their companies need to accept a broader responsibility than short-term profits, recent research suggests that as corporate social responsibility (CSR) and social reporting become more widespread, there is little empirical evidence of the range of stakeholders addressed through their CSR programmes and how such programmes are reported. Through a CSR framework which was developed in an exploratory study, we explore the nature of stakeholder relationships reported across leading FTSE companies and the importance they attach to communicating both social and business outcomes. It is evident from the hypotheses tested that the bigger FTSE companies, particularly extraction companies and telecoms, are more adept at identifying and prioritising their stakeholders, and linking CSR programmes to business and social outcomes. However, we draw the general conclusion that building stronger stakeholder relationships through CSR programmes - other than with customers - is not currently a priority for most companies. We also conclude that a limited sophistication in managing multiple stakeholders may compromise the impact of CSR upon business and social results. Finally, the managerial implications and the contribution of our study are discussed before closing with an acknowledgement of the limitations of this work and suggestions for further research. {\textcopyright} Springer 2005.},

This article assesses the comprehensiveness and the value of currently reported quantitative environmental disclosures of 97 listed companies from the automotive, banking, pharmaceutical and electronic hardware sectors. Findings indicate that quantitative environmental disclosures have many limitations, including incompleteness and inconsistency regarding corporate activities and sites, and limited internal data coherence. For many sectors, corporate disclosures only cover a very small share of the total environmental burden of products. A stepwise procedure is proposed to verify and improve the quality and completeness of reporting using life cycle approaches. We present simple data quality tests, and we introduce the concept of the environmental influence matrix, which provides a solid basis for the identification and prioritization of key performance indicators and areas of action. {\textcopyright} 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.},

abstract = {This study analyzes corporate social reporting in Mexico as it has evolved in recent years, expanding and updating a previous study. Two sets of Mexican companies were identified, each of whom had expressed a commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) through social responsibility reports and practices on their websites. One set ("first generation") were identified as early adopters of CSR reporting in Mexico by a previous study published in 2006. The second set ("second generation") has adopted CSR reporting practices since the data collection for the first study was finished. Through content analysis of the websites of both these "first generation" and "second generation" companies, general CSR reporting practices in Mexico were assessed. "First generation" companies were found to more frequently issue CSR reports and have them available in more languages than "second generation" companies. "First generation" companies also refer to stakeholders, citizenship, human rights, and code of conduct more often than "second generation" companies. The results suggest that "first generation" companies in recent years have reduced the use of local norms that focus on Mexican values, philanthropy, and a Spanishspeaking audience, and are moving more toward global norms of abiding by international standards that emphasize concrete reporting norms, along with social and environmental goals. At the same time, "second generation" companies are evolving their reporting norms in a way similar to what was observed in "first generation" companies, emphasizing local norms in their initial CSR reporting. {\textcopyright} Springer 2010.},

Starting from the sample of companies from the multi-utility sector (chosen because the utilities sector is subject to particular attention and pressure by customers and the community), an evaluation of alreadyimplemented criteria and the principles of sustainability reporting is provided, going through each report. This paper also highlights the different maturity levels of companies in the application of the principles required by the main reporting models used in the world (Global Reporting Initiative Third Generation: GRI-G3; AA1000 SES Accountability 1000: AA1000), and investigates the reasons for the different approaches to the models' various principles/criteria. Both the level of the materiality of the reports and the inclusiveness of stakeholders are lower than other principles, even for sustainability reports from companies with a high level of compliance. As a result of this study, strategic motivation has been recognized as the discriminatory element with respect to the quality of reports, especially in companies of considerable size.

Our article is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the reasons underlying the adoption of SER by Italian local authorities by applying the concept of management fashion (Abrahamson 1996). Empirical analysis shows that both socio-psychological and techno-economic forces combine to shape the SER phenomenon, and a managerial fashion is currently in place among Italian local authorities. Thus, even when SER is adopted in response to 'technical' gaps, its label largely depends on its being driven by the need to signal that LAs are adopting a tool which is gaining momentum in academic and professional discourse. However, both forces are influenced not so much by a concern for sustainability as by the context of public-sector reform processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.},

It fails because of the lack of what the Global Reporting Initiative calls sustainability context, a shortcoming from which it, too, suffers. We suggest that this missing context calls for a new notion of sustainability (the binary perspective), which can be conceptualized in the form of sustainability quotients. We provide specifications for such quotients in ecological and social contexts, and suggest that sustainability is best understood in terms of the impact organizations can have on the carrying capacity of non-financial capital, or what in the social case we call anthro capital. We conclude by introducing a quantitative quotients-based method for measuring and reporting on the social sustainability of an organization, the social footprint method.

@article{Magness2003,
abstract = {Corporate financial statements do not include environmental values. This deficiency has contributed to the criticism that company managers do not include environmental impacts in the internal decision-making process. The accounting profession has not developed effective environmental reporting guidelines. This situation contributes to a second problem: the apparent inability of corporate reports to provide useful information to external parties. It has been suggested that by using nonmarket valuation methodologies, financial statements can be used to measure progress toward sustainable development. Nonmarket valuations are not generally accepted by the accounting profession. They are too subjective to support effective decisions, and too costly to obtain. Furthermore, demand for this sort of information appears small. Some of these issues may be resolved over time. The most serious challenge, however, concerns how enhanced financial reports would be used. Financial statements are supposed to help investors assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash flows. A substantial portion of environmental value is based on nonuse benefits, much of which will never be realized in company cash flows. In other words, the role of financial statements would have to change. Furthermore, since there is no general agreement as to the meaning of "sustainable development," efforts to operationalize the term have been fraught with difficulty. Moreover, monetization of environmental values could jeopardize their preservation, leaving some to question the overall objective of this form of reporting. For these reasons, while it is to be hoped that better reporting of environmental impacts will be forthcoming, the greatest advances will likely be outside the financial statements themselves.},

Applying these principles, we develop a benchmark set of social disclosures appropriate to Islamic banks.

In addition, content analysis is undertaken to measure the vol- ume of social disclosures. Our analysis suggests that social reporting by Islamic banks falls significantly short of our expectations.

The study is also unique in that the effectiveness of ISO14001 is considered in relation to environmental regulations. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, both ISO14001 and report publication help reduce all three impacts; the former appears more effective in all areas except wastewater. Second, environmental regulations do not weaken the effect of ISO14001. Third, assistance programs offered by local governments-a voluntary approach-promote facilities' adoption of ISO14001. These findings suggest that governments can use command-and-control and voluntary approaches concurrently. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

As CSR is a relatively new concept in Finland, the paper also contributes to the discussion on interface between HR reporting (especially as based on measurements such as Human Resource Accounting and Intellectual Capital schools) and corporate social reporting practices. The results of the content analysis indicate that social reporting practices are still at an early stage of development in Finland. The most reported theme was 'training and staff development'. A positive sign was that the majority also disclosed themes 'participation and staff involvement' and 'employee health and well-being'. Furthermore, nearly one-third made references to their work atmosphere or job satisfaction survey. However, disclosures lacked overall consistency and comparability with each other and especially quantitative indicators were disclosed by few. Further concern was lack of information related to the theme equal opportunities and going beyond a sheer disclosure of age or gender structure. The other issues rarely disclosed were those related to employee work-life balance and integration of disadvantaged groups in the labour markets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer 2006.},

To accomplish the study, certain companies belonging to different sectors of activity were chosen and all the companies belong to the IBEX-35, which comprises the main Spanish companies on the Stock Market. Findings - In light of the results obtained it can be considered that the firms analyzed through the social information they present do manifest and make known their ethical behavior, behavior considered as the good, correct and just actions of firms that seek to improve the quality of life of their workers, as well as their social conditions, in areas that are important for the workers such as employment, health and safety, training and education, non-discrimination, disciplinary practices, freedom of association, society, etc. Research limitations/implications - This work should also be extended to more companies, both nationally and internationally and not just be limited to the largest companies. There is still much to be done to cover the possible gaps in social reporting. Originality/value - This paper examines the social information of companies belonging to different sectors of activity and how by means of this social information the firms reveal their ethical behavior.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the extent to which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) disclose their sustainability activities. NGOs may lose legitimacy because they, themselves, do not do the very things they ask corporations to do. As such, NGOs' legitimate role in corporate governance is questioned. We define legitimacy as self-organizing and self-disclosing activities in the area of sustainability. Using data from Fortune 250 (corporations) and the Forbes 200 (NGOs), we compare these two organizational types with regard to their commitment to sustainable development. Across eight dimensions of legitimacy we found that corporations outscored NGOs. Five of the eight dimensions showed statistically significant differences; two dimensions showed marginally significant findings (p <.06). The directionality of the findings indicates a greater commitment to sustainability among corporations than among NGOs. The findings suggest that an inadequacy of commitment and disclosure on the part of NGOs prevents them from claiming legitimacy in their quest to participate in corporate governance. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.},

abstract = {The forest-based industry has a crucial role in global sustainable development because of its unique raw material basis and increasing internationalisation. Using institutional organisation theory as a background this paper analyses corporate responsibility reporting in the world's ten largest pulp and paper companies, representing 25% of global production capacity. The studied companies have their headquarters in Japan, the Nordic countries or North America, and have very different geographical and cultural bases and variable company product portfolios ranging from wood-based products and printing papers to packaging boards and consumer goods. Both quantitative and qualitative economic, environmental and social metrics from the annual and social responsibility reports of the companies were analysed regarding institutionalised, culture-specific and company-specific characteristics. The results showed that regulated financial and environmental reporting leaves little flexibility for company-specific diversification in reporting. Only a few regional characteristics were identified, mainly in social responsibility reporting, while the reporting largely reflected a general North American-Nordic type of corporate responsibility and the globalisation trend of the studied companies. Regardless of the many challenges in the assessment of corporate responsibility, the concepts discussed in this paper are potentially useful tools for helping to achieve sustainable development in the pulp and paper industry. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, systems to measure sustainability, including those influenced by neoliberal discourse, lack robust definitions and fail to address the interrelationship between social, economic and environmental contexts. If sustainability indicators are to help understand the interrelated forces driving change, by providing indications of sustainability, then the indicators should be derived from an epistemologically consistent conceptual framework which encapsulates clearly defined phenomena.

abstract = {The concept of sustainability evolved throughout the 1970s and 1980s, but was formally described by the 27 principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development in 1992. Despite the passage of nearly 20. years, to date there are no uniform set of federal rules, regulations, or guidelines specifically governing the environmental aspects of sustainability practices or related requirements in the United States. In this benchmark analysis, we have collected information on the sustainability programs of the five largest US companies in each of the 26 industrial sectors [based on the Forbes Global 2000 through 2009 (n= 130)]. For each company, we reviewed the most recent corporate sustainability, citizenship, or responsibility report, limiting our scope to environmental components, if available. Ten criteria were identified and analyzed, including leadership, reporting, external review, certification, and individual components of environmental sustainability programs. With respect to the prevalence of sustainability components between various business sectors, we found that the Drugs and Biotechnology (87%), Household and Personal Products (87%) and Oil and Gas Operations (87%) industries had the most comprehensive environmental sustainability programs. Using the nine components of environmental sustainability as a benchmark, we identified four key components as the characteristics of the most comprehensive environmental sustainability programs. These were (1) empowering leadership with a commitment to sustainability (80%), (2) standardized reporting (87%), (3) third-party evaluation of the sustainability programs (73%), and (4) obtaining ISO 14001 certification (73%). We found that many firms shaped their own definition of sustainability and developed their associated sustainability programs based on their sector, stakeholder interests, products or services, and business model. We noted an emerging area that we have called product sustainability - one in which toxicologists and environmental scientists can play a vital role helping to ensure that a manufactured item will indeed be considered acceptable for distribution now, as well as in the coming years. Numerous examples or case studies are presented. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {This paper identifies initiatives related to corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the airline industry and evaluates the overall state of their adoption as reported by members of the three largest airline alliances. Of 41 airlines, only 14 had annual CSR reports publically available in January 2009. Reports were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach. Results showed a stronger focus on environmental issues than on the social or economic dimensions of CSR. Of the seven major environmental themes examined, emission reduction programs predominate. Other environmental issues receive much less attention, with no single other initiative implemented by all airlines. Four social and environmental themes were found, including employee wellbeing and engagement, diversity and social equity, community wellbeing and economic prosperity. The data analysis supported the arguments made in the literature that the airlines report CSR initiatives using differing or inconsistent measurements, making evaluation and comparison of their performance and effectiveness difficult. Although a large number of airlines publishing CSR reports discussed their achievement of major goals (reduction of emissions, increasing community involvement or increasing workforce diversity), a much smaller number provided detailed information relating to specific initiatives implemented in order to contribute to these goals. Further, important issues for CSR research are posed in the paper. {\textcopyright} 2011 Taylor & Francis.},

The scheme has significantly increased understanding by policy-makers, the biofuels industry and its supply chains on how to monitor and manage the sustainability risks of biofuels and increase their greenhouse-gas benefits. It is providing a practical model for similar developments globally. To receive certificates in order to meet volume obligations under the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO), suppliers must provide a monthly carbon and sustainability report on individual batches of renewable fuels they supply into the UK. The Renewable Fuels Agency produces aggregate monthly reports of overall performance and quarterly updates of individual supplier performance. This scheme is an important first step to assist the biofuels industry to demonstrate its environmental credentials and justify the subsidies received.

In particular, the empirical analysis deals with the analysis of the non-financial reports (i.e. social, environmental, sustainability report, environmental statement, and/or SA8000 report) published by a sample of Italian companies. The taxonomy involves 47 different LSR practices classified based on five areas, namely Purchasing Social Responsibility, Sustainable Transportation, Sustainable Packaging, Sustainable Warehousing, and Reverse Logistics. The practices are further investigated to assess which and to what extent they are adopted by different categories of companies. To this aim, we use an ad hoc-defined metric, the Adoption Index, and carry out a cross-analysis. By providing an encompassing view of all the LSR issues and practices, our paper represents an initial attempt to fill a gap in the literature on LSR. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Managing global water resources and providing water services to the world's people raises a continuing series of challenges, driven by increasing expectations, and a growing competition for water, which will be exacerbated by climate change. This paper explores how concepts of water governance and sustainability may help us to meet those challenges. Water governance is often equated with the role of government or management in the provision of water services. By contrast, we see governance as the system of actors, resources, mechanisms and processes, which mediate society's access to water. A broad conceptual framework is presented for the analysis of water governance, based on linkages between the resources available to society, the mechanisms that shape access to water and the outcomes of those mechanisms, both for people and the ecosystem. These linkages are mediated both by stakeholders and by management processes. It is argued that this conceptual framework offers a robust analytical tool for planning for sustain- ability as it is able to account for the complexities of water governance (of contexts, stakeholders, arrange- ments and uses). The paper concludes with observations about the ways in which the framework can be used to understand how different water governance arrange- ments produce variable outcomes in terms of sustain- ability.},

abstract = {The objective of our work is to propose the integration of two complementary statements on financial information: the social report and the intellectual capital report. Both are statements of great importance in the current business context. The motive behind our proposal is that, in reviewing the current situation, we observed an overlap in the contents and goals of the two reports. For instance, information of a social nature is dealt with in the different blocks of analysis of intangibles in the intellectual capital report. Furthermore, these disclosures share the direct or indirect goal of improving the company's corporate image, which also reflects the links between the two types of reports. Hence, given the observed similarities and the greater flexibility and scope of the intellectual capital report, we propose incorporating the social report into the intellectual capital report. The benefits of this will be twofold: a reduction in the direct costs of preparing the report, and a simplification of the non-financial information for the different stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

We have compared the environmental reports presented by companies in the Swedish transport sector in relation to their carbon dioxide emissions, choice of indicators, and long-term goals. It is concluded that these reports cannot be used for benchmarking, nor for useful ranking of performance. The supply chain structure of the transport sector creates a problem with assigning the liability for carbon dioxide emission along the chain. The dramatic changes required by the transport sector in connection with climate change indicate that marginal improvements have to be assessed regarding long-term sustainability criteria. Comparing the situation of the transport companies to the criteria for applying backcasting we find that companies in the sector are well suited for using backcasting as a tool for strategy development. It is suggested that explicit contractual agreements of CO2 performance of transport services are used to increase awareness and responsibility. Further it is suggested that integrated supply chain backcasting may be attempted as a way to identify efficient long-term strategies. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {According to the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs (2001), transparency by means of Sustainability Reporting should lead to better Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) performance of companies. Sustainability Reporting should also give consumers the information they need to purchase the most sustainable products available (Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, 2004). This article analyses the driving factors influencing CSR and Sustainability Reporting at seven breweries in the Netherlands. It also gives a better understanding of organizational behaviour with reference to CSR and the reasons breweries have for Sustainability Reporting. The Dutch government has no intention of forcing organizations to publish a sustainability report, since it is trying to diminish the volume of legislation. Rather, the government prefers to rely on the willingness and initiatives of organizations to make CSR a success. In 2006, the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs will evaluate the effect of its CSR policy. But is it a success already? During our research, breweries appeared to find CSR more important than Sustainability Reporting. Sustainability reporting is, for most breweries, not the way to reach stakeholders. Most stakeholders have their own means for receiving information e.g. annual reports, meetings, public statements and press releases. Although small breweries think CSR is very important, they feel no pressure from outside to publish a sustainability report. For them it is very complex and expensive to publish a sustainability report. Large breweries feel pressure from many stakeholders to be transparent, but not on a regular basis. We conclude from this research that CSR does not stimulate Sustainability Reporting, but neither does Sustainability Reporting stimulate CSR. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Managers and stakeholders are increasingly aware of the importance of the environmental impact of a firm's operations when assessing risk and attempting to determine future profitability. Unfortunately, financial accounting systems often fail to fully disclose these environmentally-related costs. The reasons underlying this incomplete disclosure are myriad, ranging from measurement issues to the structure of the firm's chart of accounts. In many ways, the issues facing managers and stakeholders who are attempting to assess environmental costs arising from business operations resemble the issues faced when attempting to determine the costs of producing poor quality products. The negative impact on the environment from business operations can be viewed as a failure in the same way that the negative impact of producing a defective product can be seen as a production control failure. Similarly, costs are incurred to prevent and detect environmental failures, and the cost of failure-particularly if not addressed within the firm-can be huge and unknowable. Drawing on the experiences of firms employing quality measures and reporting, this article presents an environmental cost reporting model to provide greater transparency on environmental impact of business operations to managers and firm stakeholders. {\textcopyright} 2011 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.},

abstract = {Since the 1990s several large companies have been publishing nonfinancial performance reports. Focusing initially on the physical environment, these reports evolved to consider social relations, as well as data on the firm's economic performance. A few mining companies pioneered this trend, and in the last years some of them incorporated the three dimensions of sustainable development, publishing so-called sustainability reports. This article reviews 31 reports published between 2001 and 2006 by four major mining companies. A set of 62 assessment items organized in six categories (namely context and commitment, management, environmental, social and economic performance, and accessibility and assurance) were selected to guide the review. The items were derived from international literature and recommended best practices, including the Global Reporting Initiative G3 framework. A content analysis was performed using the report as a sampling unit, and using phrases, graphics, or tables containing certain information as data collection units. A basic rating scale (0 or 1) was used for noting the presence or absence of information and a final percentage score was obtained for each report. Results show that there is a clear evolution in report's comprehensiveness and depth. Categories "accessibility and assurance" and "economic performance" featured the lowest scores and do not present a clear evolution trend in the period, whereas categories "context and commitment" and "social performance" presented the best results and regular improvement; the category "environmental performance," despite it not reaching the biggest scores, also featured constant evolution. Description of data measurement techniques, besides more comprehensive third-party verification are the items most in need of improvement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {This paper presents a preliminary compilation and analysis of the water reported to have been consumed by a range of various mineral commodities and compares it to mine production data. This has been undertaken to assess and quantify the 'embodied water' of mineral products-a key aspect of sustainability (embodied water is the total water required to produce a good or service). At present, although the use of formal reporting protocols such as the global reporting initiative (GRI) is increasing, there are still critical weaknesses. Some key aspects to facilitate proper water accounting are not listed in sustainability reports, including the extent of recycled water used, mine site water inventories, the quality of various waters, and impacts on water resources. Based on the data compiled, there is wide variation in the water used for different mineral commodities as well as for the same commodity. There is little evidence for 'economies of scale' in base metals and bulk minerals, though for precious metals (gold, platinum), greater throughput does tend to lead to greater efficiency. For many mines, there is little evidence of improving efficiency over time, although some mines have made substantive improvements in reducing water consumed. The grade of ore being processed is clearly critical in understanding the embodied water of minerals, with declining ore grades leading to an increased chance of higher embodied water in the future. Given that many metals are declining in average ore grade, the sensitivity of embodied water to ore grade provides a major sustainability challenge for mining generally. In summary, the embodied water of minerals is clearly significant, and will likely gradually increase in the future, and so must be more completely accounted for to understand a fundamental aspect of sustainability and mining-that of water resources. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {With the increase in awareness of environmental issues, the level of environmental disclosure and stakeholder demands for environmental information is increasing. New developments in the ISO 14000 standards also make it more evident that a company's environmental performance as well as its environmental reporting should be considered as strategic issues in business strategy. Especially for a developing country like Malaysia, many companies are under external pressures to improve their environmental performance. In this study, a review on the image and environmental disclosure, together with the challenges in environmental information management and a short case study are presented. Subsequently, the paper explores some of the strategic implications of environmental reporting as an important tool for improved environmental management. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In Western Europe, corporate (social) responsibility (CR) has become a popular concept that no major company can afford to ignore. However, what about the major companies from the new Central-Eastern Europe (CEE) Member States? The present paper is one of the first attempts to analyse the understanding and relevance of the CR of some major CEE companies that are leaders in sustainability reporting. This analysis is conducted in direct comparison with a similar analysis on major Western European companies. Methodologically, the paper intertwines two qualitative strands of research: an analysis of 19 CR reports (12 from CEE and 7 from Western Europe) provides a general impression about the understanding of CR across different socio-political contexts. This report-based depiction is complemented by two surveys of 22 companies (11 from CEE and 11 from Western Europe). The surveys show the relevance that the companies attach to specific CR issues. Overall, the paper concludes that the understanding of CR is context-specific, but also that, in the case of major companies that are leading in CR reporting, the differences are not as stark as one might expect. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Using survey data on CSR disclosures in Indonesia, this study applies factor analysis to identify relationships among nine CSR characteristics. The statistical results indicate that the relationship between CSR contents, incentives, format, public confidence, and impact on investment decisions is positively and directly related. Furthermore, incentives also influence investment decisions via CSR contents, formats, and changes in public confidence. However, there is no significant relationship between expectations, importance of CSR reporting, CSR reputation, and level of public confidence in both direct and mediating models. The results also show that there is significant difference in stakeholders' perceptions of CSR disclosures among gender, age, job category, and work tenure. These findings provide better insight for reports and regulators on the appropriateness of CSR and policy implications related to impact on investment decisions. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.},

However, the sector has been applying corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. In an attempt to identify the best practices regarding CSR and trends therein we developed a CSR benchmarking of companies from the real estate sector owning and developing shopping centres. Based on information from websites, annual, environmental and sustainability reports, and customer services department's information, in 2004 and 2010, a comparative CSR benchmarking was performed on 23 real estate companies with shopping centres based in Europe, China, Australia and the USA. The CRS benchmarking framework focused on reported CSR practices and included categories and sub-categories of evaluation in four domains: (1) external results, (2) internal results, (3) management processes and (4) learning and innovation. The framework was inspired by the sustainability balanced scorecard structure. The United Kingdom real estate sector's companies studied did relatively well when evaluated by the framework used in this study. The highest ranked real estate companies applied sustainable or environmental buildings standards and did show a commitment to transparency and CSR disclosure. The positive evolution of CSR practices in the 23 companies studied in 2004 and 2010 may reflect efforts to improve competitiveness and the reputation of the companies with shopping centres through CSR initiatives. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We find significant differences between different types of insurers and between countries. The results also suggest that social and ethical aspects of CSR are better integrated in the business activities of insurers than environmental aspects are.

abstract = {A determination of the sustainability performance of a company ought to fulfill certain requirements. It has to take into account the direct impacts from on-site processes as well as indirect impacts embodied in the supply chains of a company This life cycle thinking is the common theme of popular footprint analyses, such as carbon, ecological, or water footprint- ing. All these indicators can be incorporated into one common and consistent accounting and reporting scheme based on economic input-output analysis, extended with data from all three dimensions of sustainability. We introduce such a triple-bottom-line accounting framework and software tool and apply it in a case study of a small company in the United Kingdom. Results include absolute impacts and relative intensities of indicators and are put into perspective by a benchmark comparison with the economic sector to which the company belongs. Production layer decomposition and structural path analysis provide further valuable detail, identifying the amount and location of triple-bottom-line impacts in individual upstream supply chains. The concept of shared responsibility has been applied to avoid double-counting and noncomparability of results. Although in this work we employ a single-region model for the sake of illustration, we discuss how to extend our ideas to international supply chains. We discuss the limitations of the approach and the implications for corporate sustainability. {\textcopyright}2009 by Yale University.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between environmental reporting and corporate governance attributes of companies in Australia. The paper adopts a quantitative analysis approach. It examines the 2008 annual reports of the largest 100 Australian firms listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to determine the amount of environmental reporting – these data are compared with various corporate governance measures. Analysis found a significant positive relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and the proportions of independent and female directors on a board. The analysis did not, however, support a negative relationship between the extent of environmental reporting and institutional investors and board size as has been previously predicted, rather, it showed a positive relationship. This paper offers insights to both regulators and company strategists. Regulators such as the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) could consider expanding its Corporate Governance Council guidelines to include consideration of the environment, which is increasingly considered to be an important aspect of corporate social responsibility, and one of the responsibilities of the board of directors. In addition, for companies which include a commitment to the environment in their mission and strategies, it suggests consideration of the impact of board structure and composition is important as both of these are shown to have a significant effect on the amount of environmental information disclosed by companies. {\textcopyright} 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

The growing necessity to include the social dimension in reporting practices raises important questions about the nature of social responsibility and its impact on corporate and individual behaviour and performance. The literature has yet to provide a reliable theoretical definition of corporate social responsibility and performance, however. Based on the approach proposed by Simons, we argue that organisational reporting about social responsibility can be viewed as a learning tool in some instances. Under this view the design and implementation of corporate social reporting procedures may lead to individual and organisational dynamic changes that foster organisational performance. Research propositions are then derived from the analysis. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

@article{Scott2006,
abstract = {Capitalism is often defined as an economic system where private actors are allowed to own and control the use of property in accord with their own interests, and where the invisible hand of the pricing mechanism coordinates supply and demand in markets in a way that is automatically in the best interests of society. Government, in this perspective, is often described as responsible for peace, justice, and tolerable taxes. This paper defines capitalism as a system of indirect governance for economic relationships, where all markets exist within institutional frameworks that are provided by political authorities, i.e. governments. In this second perspective capitalism is a three level system much like any organized sports. Markets occupy the first level, where the competition takes place; the institutional foundations that underpin those markets are the second; and the political authority that administers the system is the third. While markets do indeed coordinate supply and demand with the help of the invisible hand in a short term, quasi-static perspective, government coordinates the modernization of market frameworks in accord with changing circumstances, including changing perceptions of societal costs and benefits. In this broader perspective government has two distinct roles, one to administer the existing institutional frameworks, including the provision of infrastructure and the administration of laws and regulations, and the second to mobilize political power to bring about modernization of those frameworks as circumstances and/or societal priorities change. Thus, for a capitalist system to evolve in an effective developmental sense through time, it must have two hands and not one: an invisible hand that is implicit in the pricing mechanism and a visible hand that is explicitly managed by government through a legislature and a bureaucracy. Inevitably the visible hand has a strategy, no matter how implicit, short sighted or incoherent that strategy may be.},

abstract = {Instrumental stakeholder theory considers the performance consequences for firms of highly ethical relationships with stakeholders, characterized by high levels of trust, cooperation, and information sharing. While research suggests performance benefits, an obvious question remains: If instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder treatment is so valuable, why isn't it the dominant mode of relating to stakeholders? We argue that the existing instrumental stakeholder theory literature has three shortcomings that limit its ability to explain variance in performance. (1) Little theory exists around how instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder management could provide sustainable competitive advantage. (2) The literature has largely neglected the potential downsides (i.e., costs) associated with pursuing these sorts of stakeholder relationships. (3) There is a paucity of theory on the contexts in which the incremental benefits of instrumental stakeholder theory–based stakeholder relationships are most likely to exceed the costs. As our primary contribution, we develop a theoretical path from a communal sharing relational ethics strategy—characterized by an intention to rely on relational contracts, joint wealth creation, high levels of mutual trust and cooperation, and communal sharing of property—to a close relationship capability, which we argue is valuable, rare, and difficult to imitate and, thus, a potential source of sustainable competitive advantage. We also consider the potential costs of achieving this capability and identify contexts in which the resulting relationships are likely to have the greatest net value.},

abstract = {Purpose– Given the country‐specific characteristics of corporate social responsibility (CSR), there is an increasing interest in studying CSR in developing countries. Such studies play an important role in broadening people's knowledge of CSR under different economic, social and cultural conditions. The purpose of this paper is to examine the CSR reports (CSRRs) of listed companies in the largest emerging market, namely China.Design/methodology/approach– Based on a content analysis of 81 CSRRs (2007) of listed companies in domestic security markets of China (the Shanghai Security Exchanges and Shenzhen Security Exchange), the CSR features of Chinese companies are thoroughly evaluated.Findings– The main findings of the study are as follows. Only 5.05 percent of listed companies published their CSRRs in China, and 4.42 percent of them issued a separate CSRR. Most companies (97.18 percent) use “CSRR” as the name of their stand‐alone CSRRs; 79 percent of companies hold a positive attitude to taking on social responsibilities, while no company holds a negative attitude. Various social issues and stakeholders of companies are addressed in CSRRs. In general, state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) have higher propensity to address most of social issues, which may reflect that SOEs are more politically sensitive than non‐SOEs because most of the social issues are just “political slogans” proposed by the Chinese Government in recent years. However, non‐SOEs have better performance than SOEs in addressing the interests of stakeholders. Meanwhile, industrial firms show higher propensity to address the interests of stakeholders than service firms.Research limitations/implications– The results of this study indicate that CSR reporting practice is still at an early stage of development in China. Meanwhile, Chinese companies tend to follow the Chinese guidelines in issuing CSRRs rather than adopt international guidelines. In addition, Chinese companies are somewhat politically sensitive in addressing social issues. A major weakness of this study is that the sample only represents the best companies in assuming social responsibilities in China, thus some results cannot be generalized to all Chinese companies.Originality/value– The paper helps people, especially Westerners, to comprehend CSR in China. To the author's knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to examine CSR in China.},

abstract = {Purpose: Wide differences in the focus and form of corporate social responsibility (CSR) exist among countries due to the different institutional embeddedness of CSR practices. The purpose of this paper is to seek to explain them within the framework provided by institutional theory by identifying important pressures driving CSR practices. Further, it intends to extend theory by proposing a conceptual model that relates institutional pressures, CSR practices, reputation and financial performance of corporates in a developing country like India. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing upon the extant literature on the constructs, the paper describes their evolution through decades and weaves relationship between them. Institutional theory provides the framework to develop hypotheses. Findings: The model has its roots in Scott's institutional theory – linking regulative, normative and cognitive pressures to CSR practices. Reputation mediates the relationship between CSR and financial performance. Practical implications: The conceptual model can serve as a foundation for subsequent empirical research. An understanding of relationship between constructs in the model will help corporates to strategize CSR initiatives. At the organisational level, insight into managerial perceptions of CSR practices will help to identify the need for training, if there is a gap between what organisation intends and what managers perceive. Originality/value: The authors have proposed for the first time an integrative model that will help to understand the antecedents as well as consequences of CSR practices in a developing country within a theoretical framework.},

abstract = {The authors review the corporate social responsibility (CSR) literature based on 588 journal articles and 102 books and book chapters. They offer a multilevel and multidisciplinary theoretical framework that synthesizes and integrates the literature at the institutional, organizational, and individual levels of analysis. The framework includes reactive and proactive predictors of CSR actions and policies and the outcomes of such actions and policies, which they classify as primarily affecting internal (i.e., internal outcomes) or external (i.e., external outcomes) stakeholders. The framework includes variables that explain underlying mechanisms (i.e., relationship- and value-based mediator variables) of CSR-outcomes relationships and contingency effects (i.e., people-, place-, price-, and profile-based moderator variables) that explain conditions under which the relationship between CSR and its outcomes change. The authors' review reveals important knowledge gaps related to the adoption of different theoretical orientations by researchers studying CSR at different levels of analysis, the need to understand underlying mechanisms linking CSR with outcomes, the need for research at micro levels of analysis (i.e., individuals and teams), and the need for methodological approaches that will help address these substantive knowledge gaps. Accordingly, they offer a detailed research agenda for the future, based on a multilevel perspective that aims to integrate diverse theoretical frameworks as well as develop an understanding of underlying mechanisms and microfoundations of CSR (i.e., foundations based on individual action and interactions). The authors also provide specific suggestions regarding research design, measurement, and data-analytic approaches that will be instrumental in carrying out their proposed research agenda. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Those results imply that restaurant companies in the United States may increase their investment in socially responsible activities to improve their accounting performance over the long term. While the study did not investigate communication mechanisms, it may be that restaurant companies should promote their social responsibility activities to consumers (and the financial market) as a means of enhancing the effects of those activities on their value performance. {\textcopyright} 2009 Cornell University.},

abstract = {This paper advances the risk management perspective that superior social performance enhances firm value by serving as an ex ante valuable insurance mechanism. We posit that good social performance is more valuable as an insurance mechanism for firms with higher litigation risks. Moreover, value generation of corporate social performance (CSP) depends on whether a firm has gained pragmatic legitimacy (i.e., a firm's financial health) and moral legitimacy (i.e., whether or not a firm operates in a socially contested industry) among its stakeholders. We find that the value of CSP as insurance against litigation risk is practically significant, adding 2 to 4 percent to firm value. But CSP is less likely to create value if the firm is in financial distress or is operating in socially contested industries. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Recently, studies in this field have paid particular attention to the method of measurement in order to identify the CSR activities. One of the widely recognized measures to proxy CSR is the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) score. This paper examines the relationship between Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and corporate profit by testing the ESG performance score on the firm's Financial Performance (FP), specifically for Korea Stock Market (KOSPI) listed firms in the period of 2008 $\sim$ 2014. We use three separate individual Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) disclosure scores from Bloomberg for the CRS proxy measure, as well as the Return on Equity (ROE), Market-to-Book Ratio (MBR) and Stock Return for the FP measures. We found that the ESG disclosure scores (the measures of environmental, social, and governance responsibility performance) in the Korean corporations shows diversified results. Particularly, the environmental responsibility performance score presents a negative (or U curve) relationship with FP, whereas the governance responsibility performance score presents a positive (or inverse U curve) relationship with FP. On the other hand, we did not find any statistically significant evidence of a relationship between the social responsibility performance score and FP.},

We closely evaluate the interactions between social and financial performance with a set of disaggregated social performance indicators for environment, employment, and community activities instead of using an aggregate measure. While scores on a composite social performance indicator are negatively related to stock returns, we find the poor financial reward offered by such firms is attributable to their good social performance on the environment and, to a lesser extent, the community aspects. Considerable abnormal returns are available from holding a portfolio of the socially least desirable stocks. These relationships between social and financial performance can be rationalized by multi-factor models for explaining the cross-sectional variation in returns, but not by industry effects.},

abstract = {A significant body of research has found that accounting education contributes to the narrow and stereotypical scorekeeping perceptions students have of accounting, and that there is a disconnect between accounting education and practice. However, there has only been limited research into why this has occurred. This study examines how the preparer-focused accounting textbooks adopted by New Zealand universities contribute to these concerns. Given that three of the five adopted textbooks are authorised adaptations of American textbooks and one is an American textbook, these findings will have implications for educators and authors beyond New Zealand. In an effort to better reflect accounting practice, this paper calls on authors and publishers of textbooks to acknowledge the wider context within which accounting operates, and the influence of technology on the accounting process as currently practised.},

abstract = {Big Data is now readily available for analysis, and analysts trained to conduct effective analysis in this area are in high demand. However, there is a dearth of discussion in the literature related to identifying the important cognitive skills required for accountants to conduct effective Big Data analysis. Here we argue that accountants need to approach Big Data analysis as informed skeptics, being ever ready to challenge the analysis by asking good questions in appropriate topical areas. These areas include understanding the limits of measurement and representation, the subjectiveness of insight, the challenges of statistics and integrating data sets, and the effects of underdetermination and inductive reasoning. Accordingly, we develop a framework and an illustrative example to facilitate the training of accounting students to become informed skeptics in the era of Big Data by explaining the conceptual relevance of each of the topical areas to Big Data analysis. In addition, example questions are identified that accountants conducting Big Data analysis should be asking regarding each topic. Further, for each topic, references to additional resources are provided that students can access to learn more about effectively conducting Big Data analysis.},

Traditionally, enterprises require financial or non-financial reporting based on quarterly and annual periods. Yet, the rapid change that occurs on market and society causes this periodic reporting to become quickly outdated. Higher competition among enterprises demands for more updated information to enable management to rapidly adapt to opportunities and answer problems. Real-time accounting addresses these needs, but needs new technological answers. In this article we present some technologies which can help the implementation of real-time accounting, namely, business process management, mobile devices, cloud computing, business intelligence, enterprise architecture and enterprise application integration.},

The mesomorphic properties were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarizing optical microscopy (POM), and X-ray diffraction. All mesogens displayed smectic A mesophase geometries with strongly interdigitated bilayer structures. Comparison of the thioether-linked imidazolium salts with the corresponding amine- and amide-linked imidazolium salts as well as simple N-alkyl-imidazolium salts showed that both mesophase width and stability increased with increasing softness of the linking unit, thus indicating the beneficial effect of sulfur. Additionally, an increase of the length of the linking unit decreased the interdigitation of the alkyl chains.},

abstract = {The apoplast of plant cells is a dynamic compartment involved in many processes, including maintenance of tissue shape, development, nutrition, signalling, detoxification and defence. In this work we used Nicotiana tabacum plants as a model to investigate changes in the soluble apoplast composition induced in response to salt stress. Apoplastic fluid was extracted from leaves of control plants and plants exposed to salt stress, using a vacuum infiltration procedure. Two-dimension electrophoretic analyses revealed about 150 polypeptide spots in the pH range of 3.0 to 10.0, in independent protein extracts, with a high level of reproducibility between the two sample sets. Quantitative evaluation and statistical analyses of the resolved spots in treated and untreated samples revealed 20 polypeptides whose abundance changed in response to salt stress. Mass spectroscopic peptide separation and sequencing was used to identify polypeptides affected by salt stress. While the levels of some proteins were reduced by salt-treatment, an enhanced accumulation of protein species known to be induced by biotic and abiotic stresses was observed. In particular, two chitinases and a germin-like protein increased significantly and two lipid transfer proteins were expressed entirely de novo. Some apoplastic polypeptides, involved in cell wall modifications during plant development, remained largely unchanged. The significance of these components is discussed in the context of stress responses in plants.},

While research on the topic is emerging, it has this far been predominantly focused to technical and legal issues. To broaden our understanding of blockchain technology based services and platforms, we build on earlier literature on payments and payment platforms and propose a research agenda divided into three focal areas of 1) organizational issues; 2) issues related to the competitive environment; and 3) technology design issues. We discuss several salient themes within each of these areas, and derive a set of research question for each theme, highlighting the need to address both risks and opportunities for users, as well as different types of stakeholder organizations. With this research agenda, we contribute to the discussion on future avenues for Information Systems research on blockchain technology based platforms and services.},

Completing more than one degree is preferable, even if one degree was completed online, and employers are equivalently favorable if the online degree was completed at the undergraduate or graduate level. Applicants who complete a second, online bachelor's degree in accounting are also favored. The reputation of the job applicant's educational institution is of greater importance to employers than the educational environment, and separate AACSB accounting program accreditation is less important than AACSB business accreditation. Finally, employers who are familiar with online education (i.e., have taken online courses themselves) are more likely to hire an online graduate, rate online education as more rigorous, and perceive a greater potential for soft skill attainment in the online environment (albeit with preference still towards traditional applicants), as opposed to those employers without online education experience.},

The findings of the study revealed amongs others that office technology and accountingskills are moderately possessed and that all the skills are highly required by both male and female students for effective management of small scale businesses. These skills if highly possessed will make business education graduagte better prepared to take up jobs in organizatins and contribute meaningfully or be self-employed by establishing small and medium businesses. Therefore, recommendations were made, among others that the study of office technologyand managementshould be encouraged by all stakeholders, as it is geared towards office technology and entrepreneurail skills needed for the management of small scale businesses},

Unfortunately, lists of KPIs published in the past often focus on one industry and assume a generic business strategy.

abstract = {Previous literature on Serious Games (SGs) has focused on the possible impacts of these educational tools on learning effectiveness. However, the empirical evidence is still scarce, and these learning-based games are rarely used in general undergraduate courses and even less so in accounting courses compared with other business areas. Using an existing digital game and a sample of accounting lecturers, this paper uses the Delphi methodology to examine accounting academic{\'{s}} perceptions of the usefulness and the potential barriers to implementing SGs in the classroom. Our results show that the knowledge and funding of technology is no longer an issue. However, incentives to motivate and increase knowledge and use new teaching tools (such as SGs) for lecturers are low despite the perception of the benefits of these tools in the learning process. The low use of learning-based games and scarce research on SGs in accounting education compared with other business areas seem to be related to the perception that few suitable games exist for undergraduate accounting subjects. This perception mirrors the fact that accounting education is perceived by lecturers as a mere technique rather than as an integral part of the management and business decision-making process.},

abstract = {The nature of management accountants' responsibility is evolving from merely reporting aggregated historical value to also including organizational performance measurement and providing management with decision related information. Corporate information systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems have provided management accountants with both expanded data storage power and enhanced computational power. With big data extracted from both internal and external data sources, management accountants now could utilize data analytics techniques to answer the questions including: what has happened (descriptive analytics), what will happen (predictive analytics), and what is the optimized solution (prescriptive analytics). However, research shows that the nature and scope of managerial accounting has barely changed and that management accountants employ mostly descriptive analytics, some predictive analytics, and a bare minimum of prescriptive analytics. This paper proposes a Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework based on the balanced scorecard theory in a business intelligence context. MADA provides management accountants the ability to utilize comprehensive business analytics to conduct performance measurement and provide decision related information. With MADA, three types of business analytics (descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive) are implemented into four corporate performance measurement perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth) in an enterprise system environment. Other related issues that affect the successful utilization of business analytics within a corporate-wide business intelligence (BI) system, such as data quality and data integrity, are also discussed. This paper contributes to the literature by discussing the impact of business analytics on managerial accounting from an enterprise systems and BI perspective and by providing the Managerial Accounting Data Analytics (MADA) framework that incorporates balanced scorecard methodology.},

@article{Ruckershauser2017,
abstract = {Research proposing the application of blockchain technology in accounting assumes the utilization of decentralized consensus mechanisms based on the exertion of scarce resources (Proof-of-Work; PoW), leading to the validation of transactions without the need of any third party. Together with the blockchain, a shared database, PoW is expected to lead to nearly immutable and, therefore, fraud-resistant, real-time financial registers. This conclusion must be reconsidered, taking into account recurrent top-management involvement in accounting scandals, often conducted through deliberate exposures of internal and external control systems. This paper asserts that blockchain-based accounting using PoW-based consensus paves the way for the suspension of controls by the management, since exerting the majority of computer power is easier than circumventing internal and external control systems in conventional accounting systems. Alternatives to PoW must be considered for blockchain-based accounting that prevents the management from conducting fraud and, thereby, qualifies the blockchain for its application in accounting.

We argue that organisations need to be sensitised to different types of knowledge, the challenges in creating and applying that knowledge, and be more circumspect about what can be achieved through advances in information-based technologies and software. We point to both the potential of and the complexities presented by Big Data in relation to the finance function generally and to management accounting information provision specifically. We suggest that 'Big Data' and data analysis techniques enable executives to act on structured and unstructured information but such action must recognise that the traditionally presumed sequential and linear links among corporate strategy, firm structure and information systems design are no longer in play. Additionally, cost structure changes are affected by developments in how data, information and knowledge can be utilised. We discuss the outsourcing and offshoring of work and their data, information and knowledge ramifications as well as those related to cloud computing. We conclude that the possibilities for the digitally enabled business create a range of 'information literacy' challenges as well as new possibilities for accounting information providers.},

abstract = {This paper explores the applications of data mining techniques in accounting and proposes an organizing framework for these applications. A large body of literature reported on specific uses of the important data mining paradigm in accounting, but research that takes a holistic view of these uses is lacking. To organize the literature on the applications of data mining in accounting, we create a framework that combines the two well-known accounting reporting perspectives (retrospection and prospection), and the three well-accepted goals of data mining (description, prediction, and prescription). The framework encapsulates a taxonomy of four categories (retrospective-descriptive, retrospective-prescriptive, prospective-prescriptive, and prospective-predictive) of data mining applications in accounting. The proposed framework revealed that the area of accounting that benefited the most from data mining is assurance and compliance, including fraud detection, business health and forensic accounting. The clear gaps seem to be in the two prescriptive application categories (retrospective-prescriptive and prospective-prescriptive), indicating opportunities for benefiting from data mining in these application categories. The framework presents a holistic view of the literature and systematically organizes it in a structurally logical and thematically coherent manner.},

abstract = {This article presents a reflection on the role of Business Process Management and associated technologies on supporting/evolving current Accounting Information Systems. Although traditional Accounting Information Systems fulfill the need of financial reporting, collecting data from central databases and consolidating it, so that the information can be easily consumed by decision-makers, they were not created bearing in mind the idea of performing business process oriented accounting. Organizations have always worked in a business process oriented way either implicit or explicit. Business Process Management adoption as a management practice has been gaining popularity in recent years, making sense an evolution of Accounting Information Systems towards a business process oriented accounting supported on a Business Process Management Suite. The benefits of this evolution include, among others, the flexibility and agility in business process redefinition, the empowerment of knowledge workers, the implementation of control points for data collection to produce real-time reports and alerts relating the use of financial and non-financial information, so that decision-makers can act on.},

abstract = {Big Data is revolutionizing the business world as it enables companies to discover valuable insight from within the vast volumes of data now available to companies. The data analysis skills related to Big Data are in high demand, yet many accountants lack the data analysis skills necessary to improve decision making within a company or increase the effectiveness and efficiency of an audit. This case provides you with a hands-on opportunity to utilize the data analysis skills that are in such high demand. You will harness the power of Big Data while performing a procedure that is required on all financial statement audits – an analysis of journal entries for potential red flags of fraud. The case is completed in two phases. First, in Phase I, you will learn how to address one of the primary challenges in the use of Big Data – “validating” the data – which ensures that the files are complete. Specifically, you will import and analyze client files in IDEA to determine if the manual journal entry file is complete or if any records are missing from the file. In Phase II, you will validate data from a second client then perform a battery of tests aimed at identifying potential red flags of fraud. To complete the second task, you will need to consider factors such as who recorded the journal entries, when the entries were created, the description provided (or lack thereof), and whether the entries were back-posted or out-of-balance. You will also learn how to use fuzzy matching and Benford's Law.},

Forebrain glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing neurons that project to the mediodorsal nucleus were identified using a combination of retrograde tracing with Fluoro-Gold and in situ hybridization for the messenger RNA encoding the 67,000 molecular weight synthetic enzyme for GABA. Glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus were observed in the olfactory tubercle, vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, ventral pallidum, sublenticular substantia innominata, globus pallidus, lateral preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The largest proportions of glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus were observed in the vertical limb of the diagonal band, ventral pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Somewhat fewer glutamate decarboxylase messenger RNA-containing, retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in the subcommissural ventral pallidum and sublenticular substantia innominata. These data suggest that a GABAergic projection from the basal forebrain to the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus can influence the function of this nucleus.},

abstract = {This study explores Big Data practices at Facebook through an investigation of the role of commensuration or ‘the transformation of different qualities into a common metric' in the structuration of analysis and interaction with a major online social media platform. It proposes a conceptual framework and demonstrates the empirical potential of a pragmatic approach based on reading published materials and available documentation. Facebook's Data Warehousing and Analytics Infrastructure serves as an illustrative example to begin tracing out and describe data assemblages in more detail. In being attentive to the motivations, drivers and challenges engineers face when dealing with Big Data, it is argued that their solutions can enable and support but also constrain specific analytical and transactional capabilities or data flows between various devices and actors. The analysis thus moves beyond methodological critiques of the utility of Big Data that lack empirical support and specificity. It is further argued that analytics not just describe but also actively participate in the enactment of social worlds, thereby opening possibilities for new markets or market segments to arise. Online sociality accounts for a model of the social that makes it visible and measurable qua markets inviting data recontextualisation and the creation of value along multiple axes. Contra Facebook's claim to make the web more ‘social', an investigation of commensuration brings to the fore the question how the social is accounted for in the first place.},

abstract = {Companies have realized they need to hire data scientists, academic institutions are scrambling to put together data-science programs, and publications are touting data science as a hot—even ‘‘sexy''—career choice. However, there is confusion about what exactly data science is, and this confusion could lead to disillusionment as the concept diffuses into meaningless buzz. In this article, we argue that there are good reasons why it has been hard to pin down exactly what is data science. One reason is that data science is intricately intertwined with other important concepts also of growing importance, such as big data and data-driven decision making. Another reason is the natural tendency to associate what a practitioner does with the definition of the practitioner's field; this can result in overlooking the fundamentals of the field. We believe that trying to define the boundaries of data science precisely is not of the utmost importance. We can debate the boundaries of the field in an academic setting, but in order for data science to serve business effectively, it is important (i) to understand its relationships to other important related concepts, and (ii) to begin to identify the fundamental principles underlying data science. Once we embrace (ii), we can much better understand and explain exactly what data science has to offer. Furthermore, only once we embrace (ii) should we be comfortable calling it data science. In this article, we present a perspective that addresses all these concepts. We close by offering, as examples, a partial list of fundamental principles underlying data science.},

In addition to auditing, our analysis shows that existing research extends across three other genealogies: financial distress modelling, financial fraud modelling, and stock market prediction and quantitative modelling. Auditing is lagging behind the other research streams in the use of valuable big data techniques. A possible explanation is that auditors are reluctant to use techniques that are far ahead of those adopted by their clients, but we refute this argument. We call for more research and a greater alignment to practice.

In particular, it critically explores new forms of empiricism that declare ‘the end of theory', the creation of data-driven rather than knowledge-driven science, and the development of digital humanities and computational social sciences that propose radically different ways to make sense of culture, history, economy and society. It is argued that: (1) Big Data and new data analytics are disruptive innovations which are reconfiguring in many instances how research is conducted; and (2) there is an urgent need for wider critical reflection within the academy on the epistemological implications of the unfolding data revolution, a task that has barely begun to be tackled despite the rapid changes in research practices presently taking place. After critically reviewing emerging epistemological positions, it is contended that a potentially fruitful approach would be the development of a situated, reflexive and contextually nuanced epistemology.},
