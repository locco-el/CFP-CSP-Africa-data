#CHAPTER ONE
#INTRODUCTION

##Background
Businesses are more and more perceived as endowed with the characteristics of human personalities and seen as integral to the social fabric (Matten, Moon and Crane, 2005). Multinational corporations are indeed considered as global citizens and are expected to contribute to the advancement of common social goals (Lee and Tan, 2019). Gone are the days when businesses were solely evaluated on the basis of the bottom line (Arminen et al., 2018). They are now held responsible for the social and environmental impact of their activities. Now, mechanisms such as socially responsible investing (SRI) screens are used to determine which firms are invested in, based on their corporate social engagement profile (Chatterji, Levine and Toffel, 2009; Delmas and Blass, 2010). This has spurred a renewed interest in the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) (Akben-Selcuk, 2019). 
Bowen (1953) coined the phrase “Corporate Social Responsibility” to refer to business philanthropy or charity. The concept has evolved over time (Wang et al. 2016), and there are currently dozens of definitions of CSR. According to Davis (1960, p. 70) “... it refers to the decisions of entrepreneurs and to actions taken for reasons, at least partially, extending beyond the technical or economic interests of a company”.  Jones (1980, p. 59), also defined it as “... the broad voluntary obligations companies have to constituent groups of society other than shareholders, and this extends beyond what is established through law or contracts.”  More recently, CSR has been defined as involving “... a new way of doing business whereby companies manage their operations in a sustainable manner economically, socially and environmentally while recognising the interests of different public audiences they relate to (i.e., shareholders, employees, the community, suppliers, and customers) in consideration of the environment and sustainable development (Empresa, 2016)
Dahlsrud (2008) found thirty-seven (37) different definitions from an analysis of extant literature, and this number may be understated because some academically derived definitions of CSR were excluded (Carroll and Shabana, 2010). The most commonly used definitions of CSR are the ones given by the Commission of the European Communities (CEC) in 2001, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in 1999. (Dahlsrud, 2008). According to the CEC, CSR is “a concept whereby companies integrate social and environmental concerns in their business operations and in their interaction with their stakeholders on a voluntary basis”. The WBCSD, on the other hand, defines CSR as “the commitment of business to contribute to sustainable economic development, working with employees, their families, the local community and society at large to improve their quality of life.”  From these definitions, CSR is founded on the notion that corporations interact with other interests in their economic, cultural, physical and social environments because business activities affect, and are affected by such interests (Dobers and Halme, 2009). While these relationships have a strong economic dimension, they are also influenced by social and environmental concerns. CSR involves understanding and managing these relationships. This perspective is supported by the stakeholder theory. 
The stakeholder theory posits that shareholders are not the only stakeholders in business but that the interests of all parties affected by the operations of the organisation are also important (Parmar et al., 2010). The success of a business over time depends on its ability to effectively manage its relationships with its stakeholders (Barnett and Salomon, 2018). All stakeholders have the potential to affect a firm’s performance, though in different ways. Employees, customers, suppliers and creditors directly affect economic rents through their economic choices (Delmas and Toffel, 2004) while non-market constituents such as the general public, the media, and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO) conveying information that indirectly influences business performance (Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999). Thus the dissatisfaction of any stakeholder group can adversely affect economic rents and even compromise a company’s future (Clarkson, 1995). In effect, socially responsible corporate action is critical for protecting the bottom line and boosting shareholder value (Epstein, Buhovac and Elkington, 2017).
This perspective of CSR referred to as the “Business case for CSR” (Schreck, 2011, p. 167), has been interrogated extensively in the literature with various outcomes. Many studies have examined the question of whether investing in CSR is justified by gains in financial performance. The search for empirical evidence to support or refute this hypothesis has resulted in the emergence of the related concept of Corporate Social Performance (CSP).  Wood (1991, p. 693) defined CSP as “a business organisation’s configuration of principles of social responsibility, the process of social responsiveness, and policies, programs, and observable outcomes as they relate to the firm’s societal relationships”.  The notion of CSP offers a framework to measure corporate social CSR. CSP is a multi-dimensional tool that can be used to assess a business’ societal relationships (Arminen, Puumalainen and Fellnhofer, 2018).  Although the two terms CSR and CSP have been used interchangeably in empirical studies (Margolis, Elfenbein and Walsh, 2007), they differ in important aspects. Whiles CSR emphasises obligation and accountability to society; CSP emphasises outcomes and results (Carroll, 1991). As Van Beurden and Goessling (2008) point out, CSR is an abstract concept that cannot be measured; CSP, on the other hand, though difficult to measure too, can be surrogated by the use of measurable proxy variables. This makes it possible to model the relationships between CSP and other factors. 
With corporate social action now a fundamental business element, it is subject to the same considerations (financial and economic concerns) that drive all other corporate strategic decisions. It is plausible to argue then that Corporate Financial Performance (CFP) would be a key determinant of CSP. However, CFP, as an antecedent of CSP, has not been well studied (Melo, 2014). The CFP-CSP relationship, and indeed CSP and CSR, in general, are especially poorly understood in the Global South and particularly in Africa (Julian and Ofori-Dankwa, 2013). CSR in Africa is unique in both conception and manifestation. It often takes the form of informal philanthropy involving the donation of items such as cash and food, or material support for education, health and sports (Visser, 2008; Dartey-Baah and Amponsah-Tawiah, 2011; Jamali and Neville, 2011; Cheruiyot and Onsando, 2016). What passes for CSR in Africa would likely not be seen as such elsewhere.  CSR is sometimes viewed with scepticism, bordering on cynicism by both businesses and the public (Klins, Van Niekerk and Smit, 2010; Cheruiyot and Onsando, 2016). This attitude derives from the historical, cultural, economic and political realities of the African context. 
The socio-cultural environment of Africa does not recognise businesses as entities imbued with the same rights and responsibilities as individuals. The average African does not perceive corporations as accountable for their activities in the same way that individuals are. While this attitude derives in part from cultural norms around personhood, the low levels of education and civic sensibilities that pertain in the region, also contribute to it. Consumer activism for responsibly produced products is relatively weak in Africa (Klins, Van Niekerk and Smit, 2010). Even where people have had cause to agitate for social responsibility, they have often been powerless to do much about. The market conditions that pertain in the region constrain the consumer’s ability to use their patronage as a tool for lobbying for corporate social engagement. In Africa, the individual customer is not seen as a key stakeholder in most cases because their level of consumption is relatively low. The powerlessness of the consumer is further exacerbated by the dominance of a few large firms in most markets, which limits competition and choice and consequently, the consumer’s power to use their consumption as leverage. This situation is worsened by low-income levels which constrain the power to substitute one good for another.
Most African economies are fundamentally, even now, primary economies. They were set up by colonial powers to facilitate the exploitation of their natural resources.  The few actors in the secondary and tertiary sectors tend to be foreign entities, and most manufactured goods are imported. Thus CSR in Africa is to a large extent associated with medium to large companies and particularly with multinational or large foreign investors and as such is influenced by the interest of foreigners (Cheruiyot and Onsando, 2016). In such circumstances (where goods produced locally are mainly for export and goods consumed are mainly imported), the consumer can seldom use their consumption as leverage since the targeted corporations are often outside their reach. Consequently, corporations target CSR more towards enhancing their global brand than addressing social issues on the ground. A typical example is the case of communities affected by the pollution generated from mining operations run by large multinational corporations. These companies often turn a deaf ear to complaints from these communities as they lack the means to exert economic pressure on them.  Often, the only advocacy that changes corporate behaviour in Africa is that initiated and championed by individuals and groups outside of the region.  
Again, in Africa, political action often plays a mediating role in the relationship between organisations and society. This is an artefact of the centralised governance and economic structures established by the colonial masters and perpetuated by subsequent governments. Political actors often take responsibility for what are essentially business decisions. For instance, the establishment of a factory in a community is often touted as an achievement of the incumbent government and used to canvas for votes. As a result, constituents look up to the government and not corporations to address any adverse social and environmental consequences of doing business. For instance, peoples anger at the environmental degradation resulting from the activities of “galamsey” (artisanal mining) operators in Ghana, was directed at the government. The government responded in a manner akin to an actual player in the market rather than an impartial regulator. Due to this peculiar political power play, organisations find it expedient to ally with political actors in navigating the corporate social responsibility sphere. Political actors take advantage of this to gain political capital out of the CSR of businesses. Politicians receive political favour with their constituents, and in return, businesses get favour with the politicians. As a result, organisations essentially pay rent to politicians rather than to society at large.  
From the above, we expect the relationship between CFP and CSR (in both directions) to be different from what pertains in the more developed regions of the world. The variation is especially so since frameworks and conclusions derived from studies in developed countries have been shown to not necessarily transfer well to developing countries (Blowfield, 2005; Gugler and Shi, 2009; Idemudia, 2011).  Despite the demonstrated need for scholarly attention to CSR and its antecedents in institutionally constrained environments, such as sub-Saharan Africa (for example Moon, Crane and Matten, 2005; Julian and Ofori-Dankwa, 2013) few studies have explored this question. In an effort to contribute to the discourse on CSR, we explore the state of CSR in Africa, particularly the relationship between CFP and CSP. We extend the discussion by shedding light on the role of a board-level ethics function in moderating this relationship.
##Problem Statement
In the five decades since the emergence of CSR as a concept, many studies have explored the link between CSP and CFP. Most of this research has interrogated whether engaging with stakeholders’ interests, especially as related to socially responsible action improves financial performance (Backhaus, Stone and Heiner, 2002; Van Beurden and Gössling, 2008; Parmar et al., 2010). These studies have been largely based on the stakeholder theory, which we discuss in detail in Chapter 2. While its role as a determinant of financial performance has been much studied, the antecedents of CSR/CSP have not received as much attention in academic circles. 
To the extent that they have been studied, existing literature on the institutional, organisational level and individual levels (Jamali and Karam, 2018). At the institutional level, the Geopolitical landscape (Adegbite and Nakajima, 2011; Jamali and Sidani, 2011; Mitra, 2012) citizen activism (Muthuri, 2008; Robertson, 2009; Hamidu, Haron and Amran, 2015) governance, legislation and corruption (Achua, 2008; Jamali and Neville, 2011; Rahim and Alam, 2014) economic, financial and business climate (Tan, 2009; Shengtian, Weihui and Xiaosong, 2010; Castello and Galang, 2014) have been discussed. Studies at the organisational level looked at firm’s ownership (Choi, Lee and Park, 2013; Castello and Galang, 2014; Zhang et al., 2014) firm’s structure, governance, size and financial characteristics (Udayasankar, 2008; Zhang, Rezaee and Zhu, 2009; Choi, Lee and Park, 2013; Castello and Galang, 2014), firm’s CSR culture (Sandhu et al., 2012; Muller and Kolk, 2015) and Innovation (Vilke, 2014). Finally, the individual characteristics of key members of the organisation such as their cultural values and/or beliefs (Gupta and Hodges, 2012; Katamba et al., 2012; Vivier, 2013) the religions orientation (Brammer, Williams and Zinkin, 2007; Arora and Kazmi, 2012; Mandurah, Khatib and Al-Sabaan, 2012) knowledge and expertise in CSR principles (Tian, Wang and Yang, 2011; Gupta and Hodges, 2012; Kolkailah, AbouAish and El-Bassiouny, 2012) and commitment to environmental protection (Fryxell and Lo, 2003) were explored. However, there is a dearth of studies on CFP as an antecedent of CSP (Jamali and Karam, 2018). 
There is a theoretical basis for the expectation that corporate investments in CSR would be affected by economic and financial factors. The slack resources theory explains that firms increase involvement in discretionary activities, such as CSR when the availability of financial resources increases (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Surroca, Tribo and Waddock, 2010). It posits that as CSR does not form part of the core mandate of the organisation, it may be considered a discretionary activity and is thus subject to financial considerations. This idea has found some empirical support in the literature. A meta-analysis found a positive relationship between financial resource availability and social responsibility (Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes, 2003), and the findings of another study using a sample of 28 nations concurred (Surroca, Tribo and Waddock, 2010). However, these findings were made in the institutionally-stable and resource-abundant contexts of Europe and North America (Julian and Ofori-Dankwa, 2013). There has been very little evidence of this relationship applying in institutionally constrained environments, such as sub-Saharan Africa. 
While most studies on the CSP-CFP relationship have assumed that it is linear in form, there is increasing evidence that the CSP-CFP link changes in a non-linear fashion (Maqbool and Bakr, 2019). Microeconomic theory, suggests that structural adjustment and agency costs incurred on initiating CSR activities would consume considerable resources for little immediate tangible gain. In other words, CSR, in its early stages is often unprofitable. However, with time, the organisation realises positive returns from CSR investments. The benefits of investment in CSR include increased access to critical resources, political capital and better brand image. These may be leveraged to improve long-term profitability (Barnett and Salomon, 2018). There is some evidence in the literature to support this assertion. Wang et al. (2017) found a U-shaped relationship between CSP and accounting measures of CFP (Return on Asset and Earning per share). Similarly, Park and Lee (2009) identified a U-shaped effect of reputation rating, one measure of CSP, on accounting-based CFP. 
Notably, the discussion on the non-linearity of the CSP-CFP relationship has been almost all unidirectional. We found no studies to date that examined CFP as an antecedent of CSP and explored the possibility of a non-linearity of the relationship. The ‘universally positive’ relationship between CSP and CFP posited by Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003), and Surroca et al. (2010) may not apply outside the Global North, and we expect that the reverse relationship may also be different in that context. As discussed above, the peculiar economic, political and social environment of developing countries, leads to different expressions of CSR (Jamali and Neville, 2011; Rayman-Bacchus and Okoye, 2012) and this demands a nuanced examination of the CFP-CSP link within that context. Julian and Ofori-Dankwa (2013), for instance, found that CFP had a significant negative relationship with CSP, defying the “universally positive” rule. The form of the relationship between CFP and CSP in Africa is not yet clearly understood.
One important mechanism employed to integrate CSR considerations into the strategic framework of organisations is a specialised ethics function (such as a CSR or sustainability committee) on the board of directors. These committees oversee the impacts of the organisation’s activities on the community, employees, the environment, consumers, suppliers, and more. Such committees have become increasingly common, reflecting a shift toward stakeholder accountability and the creation of shared value at the highest level of firm governance (Porter and Kramer, 2011). According to the Upper Echelons Theory, the board of directors is an important influence on corporate strategic decision making (Hambrick, 2007). Further, the Resource Dependency theory, Hillman and Dalziel (2003) suggests that the existence of an ethics function provides a critical resource for managing the firm’s strategic direction in a sustainable and responsible manner. In this regard, we would expect that the existence of such a function would influence the nature of the relationship between CFP and CSP, by assigning greater priority to socially responsible business activities (Post, Rahman and McQuillen, 2015; Shaukat, Qiu and Rojanowski, 2016). Biswas et al. (2018) and Walls et al. (2012), demonstrated that the creation of specialised sustainability committees leads to improved sustainability performance. However, there has been little empirical evidence for the role of the board level ethics function in moderating the CFP-CSP relationship. 
 Critical to any examination of the CSP-CFP relationship is the operationalisation and measurement of the key concepts: CSP and CFP. Whiles CFP has been measured using generally accepted accounting and market variables; the assessment of CSP has been problematic. CSP measurement is complicated for two reasons. First, as mentioned earlier, there is no consensus on the theoretical definition of CSR (Dahlsrud, 2008). Second, CSR is multi-dimensional, and its components are quite heterogeneous in character (Rowley and Berman, 2000; Gond and Herrbach, 2006). Due to the lack of consensus and complexity of the concept, many different approaches have been used in the literature and in practice to measure CSR. These either evaluate CSP in terms of a single dimension (thus ignoring the inherent complexity) or attempt to rank organisations based on weighted measures of different CSR-related variables. The weights used in the latter approach are often proprietary, and lack transparency thus making it hard to apply them in any objective and reproducible manner. Data-driven approaches have also been attempted though to a lesser extent. Again, measures of CSP have tended to neglect the peculiarities of the socio-economic and political context of the Global South. The original conceptualisation of CSR was steeped in the concerns of investors, companies, campaign groups and consumers based in the world’s wealthiest countries, with little or no input from middle to low-income countries (Frederick, 2006; Halina, Wilson and Zarsky, 2007). Measures of CSP have similarly tended to neglect the Global South.   
##Research Questions
This study seeks to contribute to our closing the knowledge gaps identified above by investigating the following questions:
i.What is the effect of CFP on CSP in Africa?
ii.How is this relationship affected by the integration of ethical functions in corporate governance?

##Research Objectives
In pursuance of answers to the above questions, this study aims to examine the relationship between CFP and CSP in Africa and explore how it is affected by the ethical functions of corporate governance. Specifically, we set out to:
i.Develop a quantitative measure of CSP applicable to the African context
ii.Examine the effect of CFP on CSR in Africa
iii.Explore any non-linearity in the CFP-CSP relationship in Africa
iv.Assess the moderation of this relationship by the existence of a formal board-level ethical oversight structure

##Significance of Research
The results of this study have important implications for corporate governance and academia. First of all, the quantitative measure of CSP, we demonstrate here could be adapted to provide measures of CSP to aid in the assessment, monitoring and evaluation of CSP activities in Africa. As  Kühn, Stiglbauer and Fifka  (2018) note, data constraints have contributed to the disinterest in studying CSR in Africa. It is a well-known fact that the study of CSR in Africa is hindered by a data availability problem and that the data on CSR activities are scarce because it was not collected or reported (Upaa, Ugwoke and Ugwoke, 2018). However, since  CSR by definition is concerned about the responsibilities of companies with regard to other actors in society, it needs to be studied in the context of where it is being practised (Dobers and Halme, 2009). In view of this, a critical contribution of this study lies in the development of a context-specific measure of CSP which can be employed by future studies to measure CSP in Africa. The existence of such a tool should facilitate the CSR discourse in Africa.
The ability to measure CSP in an objective and convenient way should help in developing enforcement and monitoring mechanisms for regulations governing the social behaviour of business entities in Africa. Further, such measures should help plan, implement and evaluate programs to track the social impacts of doing business in the African context. Businesses should also be able to use the measure of CSP to demonstrate their commitment to socially responsible investment and thus improve their own brand image. This measure of CSP should contribute to the development of consensus on measuring CSR globally and in the African context in particular. The insights this study sets out to gain into the relationship between CFP and CSP should help generate models to predict CSP in Africa and thus to develop strategies to enhance sustainable business activities in Africa. Our findings should provide empirical evidence to enhance our theoretical understanding of CSR and its antecedents. In particular, it should help test the universality of the CFP-CSP link as proposed by the Slack Resources Theory and re-examine the universally positive hypothesis.

##Scope of Research
The study is limited to listed firms in the sub-Sahara African region. As already noted, Sub Sahara Africa has not enjoyed much research attention with respect to CSR. With the aim of drawing a comprehensive and representative picture of the status quo of CSR reporting in sub-Saharan Africa, we selected six countries - South-Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Botswana, Ghana and Mauritius-representing the largest and most vibrant financial markets in the Sub-Region. Further, the countries chosen have a common history. All of them share a common institutional heritage due to British colonial rule, a legacy of practical relevance for our study, and corporate communications are provided extensively in English. Another common trait shared are the challenges that call for CSR initiatives: widespread poverty, inadequate physical and social infrastructure, limited non-agricultural economic development, insufficient access to education, and environmental degradation. 
Our focus on firms listed on the stock exchanges of these countries is informed by two factors. First of all, In regions where governance and institutional structures are weak, such as sub-Saharan Africa (Alence, 2004), the private sector remains one of the institutions that are able to contribute to an improvement of social, economic, and environmental conditions (Campbell, 2012). Secondly, extant evidence suggests that listed companies are better reporters overall (Haddock, 2005; Haniffa and Cooke, 2005). Therefore corporate information provided is more likely to provide relevant company information needed to determine the status quo of CSP. Again, as the legitimacy theory suggests, the political, regulatory and public pressure faced by larger firms causes them to be more transparent in their reporting as well as higher analyst coverage (Brennan, Jegadeesh and Swaminathan, 1993).  This is supported by empirical evidence which shows that the bigger the firm, the more non-financial and CSR related information they disclose (Embong, Mohd-Saleh and Hassan, 2012; Siltaoja, 2014). This is arguable because they can martial more resources, experience and knowledge to do so.
Due to the lack of a standardised measure of CSP especially for our study context, we adapted the measures of the Corporate, Social, Environment, Energy Emissions (CSEEE) Index developed by Kansal and Singh (2012). The CSEEE was chosen because it was developed in a developing country (India) and provides a comprehensive list of CSR activities (ninety-eight activities in total). The index comprises seven categories of activities: Community development,   Human Resource engagement, Product/ Service Innovation, Environment, Energy, Emissions of carbon and other harmful gases, and Other CSR activities. We employed accounting measures of CFP (Return on Asset and Return on Equity) for our study in accordance with previous studies (Waddock and Graves, 1997; Walls, Berrone and Phan, 2012; Julian and Ofori-Dankwa, 2013; Melo, 2014; Leyva-de la Hiz, Ferron-Vilchez and Aragon-Correa, 2019). Further, our choice of accounting measures of CFP was informed by that fact that they are a reflection of past financial performance (Symeou, Zyglidopoulos and Gardberg, 2019) and the amount of slack resources available for CSR activity in the future. Again, accounting measures of CFP are sourced from financial statements which are readily available for listed firms. We found that market data for most of the African stock markets sampled was not available.  

##Chapter Disposition
This study will be presented in 5 chapters as follows: The first chapter introduces the research and highlights the background of the study, the problem statement, the gaps in literature, the research objectives, the research questions, and the contribution of the study to existing knowledge, the scope as well as the organisation of the thesis.  
In chapter two, pertinent literature pertaining to the key concepts of the study are reviewed. The research synthesised the various arguments of the relevant literature and further provided a critic in order to fill in some gaps in the literature. This was followed by the development of a conceptual framework.
As the study take the manuscript format, we present chapter three as two separate journal articles which cover various aspects of the study. Part one will tackle the first objective of the research and develop a quantitative measure of CSP applicable to the African context. Part two examines the relationship between CFP and CSP in African. It covers the second, third and fourth objectives of the study. Each journal article will comprise an introduction, methods, analysis, discussion and conclusion session. 
After that, a general discussion which consolidates all the insights of from the two articles will be presented in Chapter four. Here, the findings will be scrutinised with reference to extant literature. Finally, chapter five will conclude the study by summarizing the findings and making recommendations based on the findings.
